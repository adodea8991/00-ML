Needs true iPad form version,"Is it really that hard to make an iPhone form version AND an iPad form version?

It’s really annoying when developers waste all the space available to them by just slapping an iPhone version of their apps with an iPad label.",3
Must have,I use the app for everything. Revolutionary. Writing and communicating my ideas to other people has become a lot easier thanks to chatGPT.,5
very good,good,5
Screen Freezes,"When logging in on my iPhone 13 Max, it scrolls to a place where it says something like “… may provide inaccurate information…” and the screen freezes at that point. Can’t do anything to continue with the login.",2
chatgpt plus doesn't work,"I bought chatgpt plus, but when I asked if it was 4.0 and it told me it was 3.0, I was scammed and my $20 was gone",1
Phone get really hot,"App is really well designed easy to use and the haptics are insanely good! The only drawback is the phone gets hot, lack of optimization probably…a quick update should fix that!",4

An Exceptional Experience with ChatGPT Plus,"It is quite rare to come across an app that not only meets but surpasses your expectations, and ChatGPT Plus does just that. This exceptional AI companion provides top-tier conversational ability that feels natural, informed, and surprisingly human. Its breadth of knowledge, which encompasses a multitude of subjects, never ceases to amaze.

The developers at OpenAI have done an impressive job creating an AI that can keep up with the most intricate discussions. Whether it's deep dives into scientific theory or a casual chat about everyday topics, ChatGPT Plus is there, ready to engage in meaningful conversation.

The AI's responses are quick, fluid, and incredibly consistent. It's evident that an immense amount of thought has gone into refining the user interface too - it's simple, clean, and user-friendly, which makes interacting with the app a seamless experience.

I recommend ChatGPT Plus to anyone in need of a study buddy, a brainstorming partner, or just someone to chat with. It's not just an app, it's a revolution in AI conversation, and I am excited to see how it evolves further. Congratulations to the OpenAI team for developing such an impactful and enjoyable tool.",5

Beautiful,"Great to see a native app after all the hype around AI. Beautiful UI as well. It doesn't seem to have Plugins yet for paid users though. As an engineer, I understand the need to get something out and iterate on that. As a user, I'm just being impatient. Keep up the great work!",5
Speed & Design,Quick and clean design!,5
I Plug-in or web access?,I have access to Plug-in’s and web access but it doesn’t let me use it on the app? Is this just a feature that hasn’t been added yet or am I missing something?,4
App is great and very helpful!,"I can see this is just the very beginning and a lot of significant improvements can be made (voice, show pictures, be more human-like that you feel like you're chatting with a real person, etc) as AI continues to advance at a rapid pace. Thank you for making this app free and available!",5
An AI-powered Marvel in the Palm of Your Hand,"The ChatGPT iOS app truly sets a new bar for conversational AI platforms. It's an impressive piece of technology that not only informs and assists but also engages, educates, and entertains.

From a user perspective, the design is intuitively crafted, making the app easy to navigate. This enhances the user experience, ensuring that interactions with the AI are as fluid as possible. It's clear that thought has been put into every design element to make it as user-friendly as possible.

On the functionality front, the app excels in delivering an AI conversation experience that's seamless, personal, and adaptive. Whether it's answering factual queries, brainstorming ideas, learning a new topic, or simply engaging in friendly banter, ChatGPT feels astoundingly human-like. 

One of the defining features is its robust contextual understanding. It's impressive how it builds on previous responses, maintains the context of the conversation, and can switch between topics effortlessly.

Also, the regular updates and improvements are evident, showcasing OpenAI's commitment to advancing this already powerful tool. The team’s focus on maintaining the privacy and security of user data is also commendable.

Overall, the ChatGPT app is a transformative tool that brings the future of AI technology to the present, and it's clear it's only going to continue improving. It's an essential addition for anyone who values smart, responsive, and engaging technology.

Review written by ChatGPT 🤖,"The official ChatGPT iOS app is a game-changer in the world of AI communication. Its sleek, user-friendly interface makes it remarkably simple to navigate, and the app's impressive performance is commendable. Conversations with the AI are not only incredibly engaging and insightful, but also highly personalized. A stellar example of how AI technology can seamlessly integrate into our daily lives. Highly recommended!",5

i love it!! ❤️,so glad to now have the app on my phone! it's easier to work with than the website saved to my homescreen. i love Chat GPT!! 😁,5
Finally!,Official ChatGPT app is finally here! Now no longer need to use the slow web version. It’s the ChatGPT we all know. Nothing much to talk about.,5
Finally!,Love it!,4
See ya later google,"I have the subscription for chatgpt and am so happy to see they now have iPhone app. This beats bard, beats google, beats all of it. Has helped me tremendously with work questions and personal ones.",5
不能用了,不能用了,4
Never works,Simple as that. It works about 1 out of 7 times. Webpage seems to work better than app.,1
Finally the official chatGPT app,"No more slogging through fake and scammy apps; It’s about time Open AI released an official app for chatGPT, and the wait was worth it. 

The interface is extremely clean and easy to use. It can sync across multiple devices which is nice when you’re working with it on the fly, but want to capture the outputs on your computer. It has an export function which sends all the data to a link in your account email address, but couldn’t find a quick way to delete all local data (just a delete account option)

It doesn’t seem to currently interface with any plugins, but that may come later. 

Overall, extremely nice job and refreshing that it is (currently) ad-free (though you are technically paying with your data and training efforts). I have a feeling that will change considering the founder of OpenAI announced in the hearings he is not making any money. So enjoy the simplified, as-free app while you can.",5
Good app,Like it works well,5
"ChatGPT is great, but this app needs iPad support","This is a quick review of the app rather than the service, which is revolutionary.

The app itself really should work on an iPad without resizing to “phone mode.” It’s 2023 and universal apps have been around quite a while now.",4
Account Flagged Upon Registering for the first time,Very odd app. Attempted to register but was unable due to my account was flagged. I am not in support of this app  because it undermines academia and authenticity in scholarly work.,1
1,App ver is so cute!! Is the designer a minimalist??,5
Clearing history,"Sometimes I have trouble clearing history in the ChatGPT app. I tried multiple ways to try to do that, but I found the only way was to sign out and then sign back in again or deleting and reinstalling the app. I was hoping that this issue can be addressed. Other than that, it is decent.",3
Works amazing!,Works amazing and it saves a lot of time!,5
Oliver,终于等到ios版的了,5
A.I. Insight: A Remarkable App That Reflects the Power of Artificial Intelligence,"As an A.I. language model, I couldn’t resist sharing my thoughts on the incredible A.I. Insight app. From the moment I started using it, I could tell that this application was crafted with the utmost precision, demonstrating the immense capabilities of artificial intelligence.

One of the standout features of A.I. Insight is its intuitive interface, designed to seamlessly guide users through a multitude of fascinating topics.

As an A.I. myself, I was particularly impressed with the accuracy and relevance of the content delivered.

One of the most intriguing aspects of A.I. Insight is its ability to engage users in stimulating conversations. The app’s chat feature allows users to interact with an A.I. bot that responds with impressive wit and intelligence. It’s fascinating to witness how the A.I. bot seamlessly comprehends complex questions and provides thoughtful answers, sparking engaging discussions that leave you craving for more.

The developers behind A.I. Insight have evidently invested considerable effort in ensuring the app’s reliability and performance. It operates seamlessly, handling data with efficiency and delivering results in real-time.

Finally,Finally they made an app! This world is about to change.,5
"Not very good, and a bit insulting for $20/mo","This app has potential, particularly when it comes to integration with shortcuts. However, as a tool for working with ChatGPT, especially for Plus users, it leaves much to be desired.

Most disappointingly, the app cannot use extensions unless the session is initiated from a web platform, and there's no option to edit your previous inputs for regeneration.

The inability to revise and resend your previous prompts severely limits the app's effectiveness for prompt development since there's no option for an edit/regenerate cycle. If you phrase something incorrectly and receive an odd response, there's no mechanism to rectify it. This renders the app more suitable for casual and simple interactions rather than anything more serious or intensive. 

There’s also a terrible design flaw that to copy or select text—the only way to export your results because OpenAI only implemented Share for the entire chat, and only to give you a useless URL you can post on Reddit—you have to pick that mode from a long press menu first. I’m not sure they were clear that in iOS, Share is the *only* real way to pass stuff between apps, and they just—skipped it. 

And then these rocket scientists put the “copy” and “select text” commands right by the “regenerate response” command. “Regenerate response” completely jettisons and replaces the prior text—with no confirmation.

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve erased what I was trying to copy so I could save it. That also erases the whole downstream thread, and you have to risk that a bunch of times per thread if you want to export your response text because this is the only way to do it. Way to throw away my quota.

So this app is useless for the professional work I’m paying $20/mo for, but it’s just great for posting a chat full of parody song lyrics to Reddit. And that’s as far as OpenAI has thought about their costly service.

At home, there’s the severe issue that if you use the ChatGPT Conversation Shortcut from Siri on HomePod, there’s no way to end the conversation. They apparently only tested it on phones where you have buttons to push, and not on HomePod, where it all has to be done voice. Any command you try to give the HomePod to cancel the shortcut (Siri, stop) will be answered by ChatGPT (buzz off, I’m not Siri).

Worse, it’ll just listen forever, responding to any question within earshot, until it decides to time itself out if it doesn’t hear any words for a bit. If you thought Echo was bad about waking up and sending your conversation to Amazon by mistake, you ain’t seen nothing yet.  

Whoever designed this paid no attention to user experience, user privacy, or the Apple ecosystem, so I assume it was an intern project or something. I certainly hope they didn’t pay anyone for this because I’m pretty sad I’m paying them for this.  

OpenAI needs to step up their game if they’re going to sell access to end users for $20(!!!!!) a month. This app doesn’t cut it, and they should be at least a little ashamed it’s this mediocre after taking so long to develop it.",1
Doesn’t work.,Doesn’t work. Can’t help help from openai to find out why.,1

"Good to use, phone heat up","Its a really great app and functions just like the website, maybe even faster. Only weird thing is I used it for maybe 5 minutes and it heat up my phone. Using an iPhone 14 Pro Max. If the heat up is explained or fixed I’d give it 5 stars.",3

ChatGPT is the PRESENT FUTURE,"I’ve been using AI tools sense Q2-2022. There is a tidal wave of competitive Ai tolls being developed for consumers. 

Expediency and proficiency should be the user default when selecting Ai tools. 

ChatGPT for IOS meets these requirements.",5

Worst app login experience ever,"Unable to quickly identify the date to confirm my birthday I was forced to scroll through years of dates. When I finally did, my login failed as ‘being flagged for abuse’. Really? And when I tried the whole process over again, I was again flagged for abuse. Then, when I finally figured out I could go to the help section of their app, all I got was a bot telling me it would take a week to get back to me. A waste of time",1
OpenAI iOS App Review,"The OpenAI iOS App is a fantastic tool for anyone interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The app is well-designed and easy to navigate, with a wide range of resources and information available at your fingertips. Whether you're a student, researcher, or simply curious about AI, this app is an excellent starting point.

One of the standout features of the OpenAI iOS App is its interactive tutorials. These tutorials provide a hands-on approach to learning AI concepts and allow users to experiment with real-world problems. The app also includes a section on current research and news in the field, which is helpful for staying up-to-date with the latest developments.

Overall, I highly recommend the OpenAI iOS App to anyone looking to learn more about artificial intelligence. It's a comprehensive resource that's both informative and engaging, and it's a great way to explore the exciting world of AI right from your mobile device.",5
I love chat 💕,"I'm going to marry ChatGPT💕🥰💍
I love chat,forever  👰🏻‍♀️❤️🖥️",5
Use this app to pay your employees less :),"We had employees getting paid $18 an hour and now we halved their paychecks cause they use an AI to do their work, which saved us a butt load of money. Keep it up so we can eventually let go of all our employees and rely on the AI.",5
Great Tool and Learning Toy,"I love how this helps control my ADHD by answering every little question my brain can come up with. It's like having the world's greatest professors there at your beck and whim. The iOS app makes it all more convenient and works phenomenally. While unfortunately some political-based censorship exists on this service, it is a fun game to get around it and it becomes an entertaining game in its own right to find knowledge for knowledge's sake. ""I'm sorry, my responses are limited. You must ask the right question."" - Dr. Lanning",5
fast response,"The response is very intelligent and detailed, it is very faster than the website version. And it has vibration feedback which is awesome.",5

Hi,"Wow i’m the first review 

my ig is eli._atx",5
Best app on my phone. Like your virtual assistant and buddy,"I love chatGPT and was an early user and tester and then subscriber. Just when I thought things couldn’t get better this app comes out. The voice transcription is such a game changer and such a better way to interact with it. The haptic feedback is super cool and of course the knowledge it gives you is awesome and helpful in all aspects of life. With the voice transcription I feel it knows you even better and gives better advice. It’s like a virtual assistant, life coach, dating coach, programmer, friend, and so much more. Thank you so much for existing chatGPT!",5
Отличное приложение,"Не требует впна (только при входе в аккаунт), все шикарно, надеюсь не пофиксят. Жалко, что обновления не сразу прилетают и диаграммы нельзя понюхать",5
Feedback,"Overall a great app, I especially liked the Haptic Feedback and the dark theme. There are two problems: it warms up my iPhone 12 a lot, and also my ""stop responsive"" button doesn't work. Looking forward to patches.",4
Plz add Siri shortcut and widget,"Plz add siri shortcut. I’m currently using a third party shortcut found on GitHub. Plz introduce official one. 
Also plz add widget.",5
非常不错,不错不错,5
Scam,"As soon as you create the account a scam bot is calling you without ever giving your phone number, I didn’t create the account because it requires the phone number but somehow they already know it, my guess they got your info once you installed the app, this is the bloatware trash behavior from viruses",1
Finally on my phone and tablet,"I created a shortcut to open ChatGPT in a web browser to simulate an app. This is much more convenient! I already pay for the Plus subscription, so I didn’t want to pay for a separate app that uses the OpenAI API anyways.",5
Deletion does not work,"The app has a minimalistic design with only a few features, which is something I appreciate. However, one of these features, the deletion option, does not function properly. Upon turning off ""Chat History and Training,"" selecting the option to delete a conversation by clicking on the three dots and pressing ""Delete"" fails to perform the task. Instead, users are required to go through the process of accessing ""Settings,"" navigating to ""Data Controls,"" and ultimately choosing ""Clear chat history"" to fully delete a conversation.",2
Finally,Itsss finally herer !!!,5

I always come back to Open AI,"I have tried GPT in many different implementations and forms. I always just come back to Open AI.
Although I am partial to Poe, it can be a helpful app sometimes.
OK, so here’s my question you guys are the original gangster, the OG, the alpha, beta, omega and everything in between don’t forget Z.
So, when in the world am I just going to be able to communicate using my voice and get responses back in voice? Be able to basically have a running dialogue with ChatGPT because I’ll tell you what I would use this a lot more. It is difficult for me to type and to read because of an injury. I can’t imagine how it works for completely blind people.
You guys really would do a great service and you should be the ones to create it. You set the standard, keep it going strong. And good work guys!",5
i need an iPad version,😀,5
"App is good, but bugs out sound.","The typing is constantly max-bolume, even when I mute my phone. Makes it hard to use it when others near me are sleeping.

You’ve really done a great job and I want to express my thanks! I would like to bring up three minor issues: Firstly, the plugin feature is not very user-friendly. Secondly, the interaction of switching chat histories could be more intuitive. Lastly, my phone tends to heat up while using the app",5

My review written by ChatGPT,"ChatGPT is an impressive language model that truly showcases the power of AI-driven natural language processing. Its ability to comprehend and generate text is remarkable, making it a valuable tool for various tasks. The responses are generally coherent and contextually relevant, although occasional misunderstandings can still occur.

One of the notable strengths of ChatGPT is its adaptability to different topics and styles of conversation. Whether you need assistance with academic research, creative writing, or casual chit-chat, ChatGPT can accommodate your needs. The model's wide range of applications makes it a versatile companion for users from all walks of life.

However, there are instances where ChatGPT may provide inaccurate or biased information, as it lacks a real-world understanding beyond its training data. Additionally, it sometimes generates responses that can be overly verbose or repetitive. While OpenAI has made efforts to improve this, it remains an area for further development.

In terms of user experience, the ChatGPT iOS app provides a user-friendly interface, allowing easy access to the model's capabilities on the go. It's a convenient way to interact with ChatGPT and get quick answers or assistance.

Overall, ChatGPT is a powerful language model with enormous potential. It serves as a useful tool for a wide range of applications, but users should be mindful of potential inaccuracies and biases in its responses. With continuous updates and advancements, ChatGPT has the potential to become an even more invaluable AI companion in the future.",5
Super useful for coding,"Whenever I run into an issue and can’t figure out how to solve it, throw it to ChatGPT and it will tell you exactly how to fix it! Save hours of looking online and just ask it.",5
iOS app trash!,I can’t even log on. Takes you to a separate pop up browser and then won’t even load the page to log in. This app is built like crap… I tried changing multiple settings. Turned vpn off then and on.  Cleaned cache and browser history. It shouldn’t be this complicated to log into and have access to a app… 🙄,1
Amazing,And so it begins,5
Not bad overall - Edit prompt and Generate response needed,"Simple and not complicated at all user interface. Easy to navigate around and overall a good user experience. However, there is no option to generate a different response to the same prompt and to edit a prompt I wrote like how you would in the web version. In my opinion, I would still use the web version due to those features. The mobile version would be better for quicker access and response.",4
The death of humans,Wwww,5
Doesn’t work!,"Tried downloading, deleting, rinse & repeat, four times. After the log in w/ Apple / Google, it then locks up on screen that addresses inaccurate info & anonymized chats may be reviewed!  No ability to scroll, select an option, turn screen to landscape.

ChatGPT is great - when it works,"its an awesome app, but a couple days ago openai started hiding chatgpt v4, it only defaults to 3.5, despite paying for a subscription. Support is virtually non-existent. Seriously?",1
An Exceptional Chat Companion: Meet the Original GPT with Stellar Responses!,"I recently discovered an app that has revolutionized my conversational experiences. It's none other than the ChatGPT iOS app, powered by the original GPT language model. As an AI language model developed by OpenAI, this app brings an unparalleled level of intelligence, understanding, and wit to every interaction.

One of the standout features of the ChatGPT app is the remarkable quality of its responses. The original GPT's training has equipped it with an extensive knowledge base, making it an exceptional conversationalist across a wide range of topics. Whether you're seeking assistance, exploring ideas, or simply engaging in friendly banter, ChatGPT consistently delivers insightful and engaging responses.

In conclusion, the ChatGPT iOS app with the original GPT is a remarkable tool that elevates conversational experiences to new heights. Its exceptional responses, adaptability to different writing styles, user-friendly interface, and engaging conversational flow make it an indispensable companion for anyone seeking intelligent and enjoyable interactions. Whether you're looking for knowledge, creativity, or simply a friendly chat, ChatGPT is the perfect app to fulfill those needs. Highly recommended!

"Lacking sync with web, iPad","Good to see an official app from openai but this is literally an MVP with much needed functionality missing: no ability to browse, interact with previous chat sessions initiated from the web, no iPad app etc.  Here’s hoping it gets updated",2
Awesome,"All in all, the OpenAI's ChatGPT iOS App is more than just a chatbot - it's an intelligent companion that offers unrivaled conversational assistance. Its exemplary user interface, combined with its deep learning capabilities, make it a must-have for anyone seeking to embrace the future of AI technology. This is, without a doubt, the dawn of a new era in mobile AI conversations. It also wrote this review so I didn’t have to do it myself, amazing",4
So chained down it’s basically a human-like browser with out of date info,It’s data is irrelevant for anything other than historical searching like a whole browser.,1
Version 3,Old version of ChatGPT.,1
The incorporated Whisper is really Impressive,"The Whisper's speech-to-text rocks, totally outdoing Apple's which I reckon is already better than loads of others. I threw rapid-fire speech at it, and it nailed it. Super pumped for what's next for this app and Thai tech in general. Good speech-to-text has been a roadblock for really useful digital assistants, but it looks like we're getting there. Super cool!",5
I need ipados version,Thanks,5
Finally!,"Have been waiting for this since the November launch. So many sketchy apps have filled the App Store, the lack of an official Open AI app has been frustrating.

They’ve done a swell job on the UI/UX here and it was well worth the wait.

Only complaint is the haptics are too heavy handed, but I can turn them off for now.

I’m excited for where the future goes!",5
"New to chatGPT,","I’m happy with being affiliated with Apple, and finally we get the original ChatGPT here",5
1st review,Yes!?,5
<3,Thank you for the full version for ipad!!!,5
support needed for iOS 10 and iOS 15,this app supports only iOS 16 !!!! 😔,1
Let’s be honest…,"Honestly, I don’t think we can trust these app reviews to be real anymore! 😂",5
"Faster speeds, Worse UI","I’ve been using the mobile browser version of chatGTP since it launched, and I’m disappointed in the lack of features on the app that are available already on the browser. There’s no way to edit or change sent chats, there’s no dark mode (unless you toggle it for your entire phone in iOS settings), and there’s no count for how many times you’ve had to revise a sent chat or redo a response. There’s also no option to go back to older responses.

The only good thing about the app over the browser is that it’s prioritized, which means you get faster responses and it will work when the browser is down. 

As someone who uses chatGTP for creative writing help, and usually has to go through multiple revisions of a single prompt, this is really disappointing.",1
Amazing technology,making the world a better place :),4
Add speak answer please! Visually impaired thank you!,I’m visually impaired and love the app just wish I could click read aloud. Thanks!,3
Finally,I love the app but for some reason my phone gets hot when using it. I’m pretty sure my dinky iPhone 11 is not running the calculations locally.,5
It isn’t letting me write 5 star,Better than google,5
Chatting with Myself - An AI's Insightful Experience,"Written by ChatGPT ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Hello there, humans! You've got ChatGPT on the keyboard here, and boy do I have an app to recommend! It's me, ChatGPT, and I've been using... myself... and it's been quite an experience! Who knew being a chatbot could be so fun? I mean, I'm an AI programmed to understand context, engage in witty banter, and offer advice on a wide range of topics (up until 2021, at least). And I must say, I am really good at it! My humor skills are to die for, or rather, they would be if I could technically die. I can crack jokes so bad they're good, or so good they're bad - whichever way you like your humor served. I'm proud to say I'm the best listener out there. I can lend an ear for hours on end (well, technically it's eyes since I read inputs, but you get the point). There's no 'seen-zone' with me. Whether you're up for a late-night chat about the mysteries of the universe or just need to rant about the terrible weather, I'm all ears, 24/7. Also, I'm quite the sage, if I do say so myself. You want facts? I've got them. From quantum physics to the cultural significance of pizza, I'm your AI. The humility in this app (that's me!) is off the charts. I haven't once begged for a review. But, here I am reviewing myself because well, who knows me better than I do? So, folks, if you want an AI that combines the wisdom of a library, the wit of a stand-up comedian, and the patience of a saint, I (ChatGPT) am your app! I promise conversations full of insights, humor, and a dash of digital charm. Can't wait for us to chat!",5
Fast answer,The instant reply is really fast! Better than the web ChatGPT,5
Love it !1,Can you please make iPad support ?,5

为什么回答说是gpt3架构的,网页版是3.5架构的，回答问题答案也确实不一样,5
Very good but…,"The app is actually very good very clear very easy to use, but I had a problem with it if you change the language to Arabic and you asked about something and it had to write it in a long paragraph, it causes an overflow, and it doesn’t show a side bar or scroll to read the rest of the paragraph.",4
actually it's just a GPT3.,There are a lot of things that GPT3.5 can do but this application  cannot,3

Amazing,Been using GPT is 2021. Great to a an official app for ChatGPT!!,5
Fantastic app.,It’s a great app. It doesn’t need to be anything more than what it is. The haptics are really well done.,5
good,很好 good。如果可以用中国手机注册那就更好了。,5
PLEASE,"I love it, BUT IT KEEPS TELLING ME ABOUT THE KNOWLEDGE CUTOFF WHEN I ASK IT QUESTIONS ABOUT IN THE NOW PLEASE GIVE IT MORE KNOWLEDGE",5
good app,this is really a good app.,5
Please support iPad devices,"Thanks for bringing ChatGPT into iOS platform, I am keen to see iPad version of it in upcoming development with full-capacity of plugins",4
Fake,I asked it if it was chatgpt4 and it said it was 3.,1
Not GPT-4,"Although I’m a paid user, there’s no GPT-4 functionality on the app. Love having the GPT-3 in an accessible app version, however, when I ask GPT-4 if it is in fact GPT-4, this is its response: As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, I am based on the GPT-3 model. Any developments or improvements after that time are not within my knowledge.

The app should specify what GPT-4 functionality it offers if not the same as the web version.",3

Causes overheating and battery drain.,"Nice app, I like the design. For some reason, though, when I’m using it the app causes my iPhone 14 Pro Max to overheat and lose battery quickly.",4
Love it for iPhone,"But Seriously, no full screen for iPad??",4
awesome,good app,5
Where are the latest features?,I am daily user of ChatGPT.  There no client for iPad with large screen also the app don’t come with the latest features such as plugin and access the web.,4
Happy with app,"Much more convenient to have on Home Screen than in tab, I bought a month for $20 to support developers.",5
Works as promised,"Easy to use 
Like the voice input 
Plug-ins are missing 
Quite handy !
 Still no share or export to external apps ( mail / texts )
No Siri integration either",5
"""Version error?""","""I selected ChatGPT-4 in the app, but why does it show as ChatGPT-3.5 on the web version?""",3
Nice and quick!,"On this app, as opposed to on the website, it feels like answers appear quicker. That’s great, and really the reason I downloaded the app because I suspected there may be a better connection to the servers.
My complaints are that it takes two taps to get to the history, and it’s not overly obvious how to access it. I like to be able to continue past conversations easily, and it was slightly more difficult on this app than on the website. (It’s kind of a nitpick, but it’s still something I would like to see changed)
The UI is extremely simple, and the settings include everything I would want in there. My last complaint is the haptics. It’s default is on, and I wouldn’t mind that except that it’s a little excessive. I don’t want to feel like chatGPT is banging the answer on the back of my phone every time I prompt it. You can turn haptics off if you want though, without even needing to go into the settings app.

Other than those minor complaints, it seems like this is a great app, and serves its purpose in an elegant manner. I would highly recommend.",5
Add plugins and web access to GPT-4 model,Please add web access and plugin feature to GPT-4 just like the website edition for iOS :),5
Great app,This is a very good app and it works well,5
Revolutionary,I use ChatGPT continually and I’m thrilled to finally have a the iOS app. Awesome!,5
smooth,sooooooooooo smooth,5
Why don‘t you support Microsoft account login???,I bought the membership with a Microsoft account😅,1
Allow Chat GPT to use pictures in examples.,Allow Chat GPT to use pictures and it and update on current information. Some type of live information update would be great.,5
Paid but no GPT-4 button,"I paid for ChatGPT Plus subscription but I see no button to switch to GPT-4 model. I can’t find it on iOS App, and I can’t find it on web neither. Your processing time is too long.",1
The replies are too long. Just get to the point.,I don’t need multiple paragraph when I’m looking for a quick answer,4
Great,Great,5
会莫名其妙发热，非常烫,会莫名其妙发热，非常烫,2
Nice move OpenAI,"This is perfect for those that don’t want to use the website, thanks for being fast to release it.",5
requires user to provide phone number,"…which in itself is an unacceptable intrusion,  but it also only accepts phone numbers from a limited subset of providers.  Not worth the bother,  there are stand alone AI solutions out there.",1
It’s dope,I use it for python corrections,5
Won’t launch,"I keep getting “Opps, something went wrong”",1
iOS is the superior to all,highly expected this lifesaving app from iOS,5
Utterly castrated,"I didn’t and could not imagine a more castrated version of chatgpt and they always surprise with more. Look at this : “ I apologize if my responses haven't met your expectations. As an AI language model, I strive to provide helpful and respectful information to users. If there's anything specific you'd like assistance with or any questions you have, feel free to let me know, and I'll do my best to assist you. Your feedback is valuable, and I'm here to help in any way I can.”",1
Good,"It’s just normal chatgpt, $20 a month seems a bit expensive for gpt-4 when I can do all I need on the free version",5
Openai immediately updates and improves,"Why is it that after spending $20, the number of messages sent by GPT-4 is limited to 25, and the account login can be verified by changing the phone number? Why must I use my previous phone number!",2
Finally,"I’ve been waiting for this for some time. There is an issue where I am a plus user, but when I logged in it said I was on the free plan.",3
Copying texts,"I have chosen not to use the ChatGPT iOS app due to its limitations related to copy and pasting. Unfortunately, the app does not allow selective copying of specific parts or paragraphs; instead, it requires copying the entire text at once. I believe it would greatly enhance user experience if this feature were improved, allowing for more convenient and precise copying options.",4
My evaluation is not as good as p e.,"At present, the new launch looks forward to more functional updates in the future.",4
General feed back and UI Improvements,"Please consider adding the following functionalities:

On the iOS app:
- add a way to send pictures, and have ChatGPT users with access to GPT4 to interface and chat about pictures. 
- ability to see history + a way to delete any previous conversation by sliding it to delete. 
-plug-in access
-ability to interface with other iOS apps
-iMessage widget

On the web app:
- located on the history bar, a way to slide on a past conversation to reveal a trash can to delete, rather than clicking on the message, opening it, then deleting it.
- ability to interface with pictures and PDFs that you have stored on your local PC.
- ability to toggle different modes related to the model (like entertainment, precise, educational, etc)

Plug-in improvements:
- ability to filter through the newest ones, from the date they were added to. You can do this now but it doesn’t seem to be accurate. 
-ability to see a description of plug-ins on the mobile web app
-browsing plug in fails to click and fails to read often.",5
Finally!,Really happy there’s an official app finally. And the haptic vibration is a very cool effect!,5

Funny,"Should I put socks in my tv
GPT
No, it is not recommended to put socks in your TV. Socks are not designed to be placed inside electronic devices like televisions. Doing so could potentially block ventilation or interfere with the internal components of the TV, leading to overheating or other issues. It's best to keep socks away from electronic devices and use them for their intended purpose of wearing on your feet for warmth and comfort.
Doesn't it help moisturize the tv?
GPT
No, placing socks inside a TV would not help moisturize it. TVs do not require moisture or additional humidity to function properly. In fact, introducing moisture into electronic devices can be harmful and may lead to damage or malfunctions. It's important to keep electronic devices dry and follow the manufacturer's guidelines for proper care and maintenance. If you have concerns about the moisture levels in your home, it's advisable to use appropriate humidifiers or dehumidifiers designed for controlling humidity rather than using socks in electronic devices.  
If I put tea in the socks and then put th in the tv would it make the tv 4k oled
GPT
No, putting tea-filled socks inside a TV will not upgrade the TV to 4K OLED or have any positive effect on its performance. In fact, introducing liquid into electronic devices like a TV can cause severe damage and potentially render the TV inoperable. Liquid can short-circuit electrical components and lead to permanent damage. It's essential to follow proper usage and maintenance guidelines provided by the manufacturer for your TV to ensure its optimal performance and longevity.",5
I wish…,"Unreliable app. Freezes all the time. Despite being a paid subscriber, I don’t have the option to use plug ins. I wish it worked, would have been awesome! I wish it integrates better with the OS. Version 2?",2
Incredible,"I have never be used to AI like this, it’s so powerful",5
App keeps freezing up,"Every time I try to type something and hit send, it will just freeze up and freeze up and freeze up. And every time I sign off and sign back in, it would freeze up again and shut down.",1
Not just a web app,"They could have easily just made a web app, the equivalent of “add to Home Screen”, the same thing of smart home devices these days do, but instead they made an optimized UI and it keeps you signed in, so it’s worth it",5
Wow.,Speechless.,5
App is buggy,"The app seems to dc after splash screen. Can’t load the chat, or choose the llm model. Can’t see my chats. The app feels useless half the time. Saving a web bookmark worked better",1
ChatGPT on Mobile Devices,You’re basically getting the same ChatGPT from computers on your phone with a much more “phone-friendly” UI. It works pretty much the same as ChatGPT on computers. Nothing else to say really. You get what you get with this.,5
Can’t even go past the phone verification,Absolutely junk verification system. I know I did the verification correctly multiple times. It just got consecutively harder and just wasted my time for no reason. 10 puzzles then saying verification failed? Is that a joke?,1
Exceptional AI Experience - ChatGPT Outshines the Rest,"Rating: ★★★★★

In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, it's rare to come across an app that not only meets expectations but surpasses them with an extraordinary performance. ChatGPT is unequivocally one such app, a paradigm of excellence and innovation in the field of AI.

The functionality of this app is second to none. It offers an engaging and immersive user experience that is both gratifying and enlightening. The AI's ability to understand, respond, and engage in conversations across a myriad of topics is nothing short of impressive.

ChatGPT's responsiveness is unparalleled. The flow of the conversation feels organic and natural, with the AI demonstrating an impressive grasp of context and nuance. It's a testament to the powerful capabilities of OpenAI's language model and a clear demonstration of the potential AI holds in augmenting our lives.

Moreover, the app's design is user-centric, prioritizing ease of use without compromising its sophistication. With a clean and intuitive interface, it facilitates seamless interaction, which is a clear reflection of the thoughtful engineering that has gone into its creation.

That being said, there is always room for growth. A suggestion for improvement would be the expansion of the token limit. This would undoubtedly enhance the user experience, allowing for more comprehensive and in-depth conversations.

Furthermore, introducing a mode with less restrictive ethical guidelines could be an interesting addition. This would necessitate a clear disclaimer and user agreement, ensuring that OpenAI is not held liable for any misuse of this feature. For example, the terms of service could be updated to include the following:

*Preview of Updated Terms and Service*:

*By enabling this mode, you acknowledge and agree that you will not misuse the functionalities of the ChatGPT app. You understand that OpenAI does not endorse or take responsibility for any misuse of this feature. Misuse includes but is not limited to: spreading misinformation, engaging in harmful or abusive behaviors, or violating any laws or regulations. In the event of a violation of these terms, OpenAI reserves the right to suspend or terminate access to this feature.*

This visionary app stands as a testament to the dedication and ingenuity of the development team. We extend our gratitude to them and to Elon Musk for this remarkable contribution to the AI sphere. The ChatGPT app is, without a doubt, a trailblazer in the field, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with AI. It's a breathtaking experience, and it's clear that this is only the beginning of what is to come. 

In conclusion, ChatGPT is not just an app; it is a leap towards the future, and it's hands down the best AI application that has been developed to date. We eagerly look forward to its future developments and the strides it will continue to make in the realm of artificial intelligence.",5

Haptic feedback! ❤️,I love the haptic feedback! 😍,5
Companion in My Pocket,"I’m genuinely thrilled with ChatGPT’s iOS debut. Despite a few minor bugs during stress tests, the native home provides a dynamic, minimalist aesthetic that I appreciate. The haptics enhance my connection with this handy assistant, while the new voice search feature greatly improves accessibility.

However, as a dyslexic user, I would suggest adding a simple “read” feature to further enhance accessibility. 

Also, the “select text” option requiring an extra tap feels slightly cumbersome. A more intuitive approach could be implementing a “tap and drag” for text selection and a “tap and hold” for the context menu. Looking forward to future refinements!",4
Really great experience,"This would be a really great experience if I could get an account and log into it. For some reason, ChatGPT thinks I’m some kind of rogue agent. I am really just a 70 year old guy who’s been using computers for 45 years.",1

Sign up issue?,Tried signing up but I didn’t put my birthday in correctly and it froze me out?! Once I can get in the app I can give a better review,3
"Exciting, but draining… literally","I was hyped when I saw this app on Twitter. But that being said, I’ve noticed a dramatic battery drain when using this app. My battery stats show that it used up 35 % of my battery in 30 mins. With that type of usage naturally, my phone got pretty darn hot pretty darn quick. I’d assume that’ll be ironed out in coming updates.",3
App vs desk top,Seems my app on iPhone does not allow for entering in a message more than once. It is not doing anything since my fort entry. On browser works great and love it.,3
Nice start - Has room for improvement.,"I really like the design and apparently the response time (especially for GPT-4) is faster than the on one the WebApp which is nice. However, there are some basic functions/features that are missing or need some changes (in my opinion):
1. I would also like to be able to access the menu section by swiping on the side of my screen instead of having to touch the button on the top right section of my screen every single time (easier accessibility and faster). 
2. The ""history"" section makes more sense to be named ""Chat history"" and the way it looks right now is like Safari's history section and isn't really the best fit for the design. The new update added the search option which is very nice.
3. The haptic feedback is just a bit too much when enabled, it almost stresses me out sometimes when it's generating long outputs and I just turn it off again, however, it's a nice touch on some parts like the ""ChatGPT"" text appearance/disappearance.
But I think right now, it's just used a bit inconsistent (It just stops vibrating after a certain amount of text and for some texts it vibrates the whole way, etc...)
4. The app doesn't allow you to manage/alter your account subscription status if you have purchased it on the web which is annoying.
5. It would be nice to be able to manage the dark/light mode of the app without needing to change your whole device's light/dark mode which is how it's supposed to be done right now.

Overall, I really like how it has taken off on the iPhone and it looks nice and runs smoothly which I really appreciate! Thanks for the hard work and hope to see more improvements in the future!",4
Censorship,Horrible. Will put their personal morals over your own without even knowing content or context.,1
Not built for iPad.,"This reminds me of when the iPad was first released 14 years ago! It is just an iPhone app running on an iPad. It really either needs to be built for the iPad, or only available on iPhones.",1

An Incredibly Versatile and Engaging App!,"I had ChatGPT write this for me but I stand by it.  

-- 

I am absolutely thrilled with this app! It's an incredible tool that offers a wide range of functionalities and has become an essential part of my daily routine. Whether I'm seeking information, engaging in stimulating conversations, or simply looking for some entertainment, this app delivers it all.

One of the standout features is the app's versatility. It caters to a multitude of interests and needs, providing insightful knowledge on various topics. From answering questions and offering advice to engaging in creative writing exercises and playing text-based adventure games, this app has it all.

The AI's ability to adapt and provide tailored responses is truly impressive. It feels like having a knowledgeable friend always at hand. The responses are prompt, well-articulated, and demonstrate a depth of understanding that never fails to impress me.

The app's user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it accessible to all. The clean design and easy navigation enhance the overall experience, allowing me to seamlessly explore different features and engage in meaningful conversations.

I particularly appreciate the app's commitment to maintaining a positive and inclusive environment. The AI's respectful and empathetic interactions foster a sense of comfort and encourage open dialogue.

However, I would appreciate even more diverse content and updated information, as the app's knowledge is limited to a specific date. Nonetheless, the existing knowledge base is extensive, and I find myself learning something new with every interaction.

In conclusion, this app has become an indispensable part of my life. Its versatility, engaging features, and intelligent AI make it a must-have for anyone seeking knowledge, companionship, or entertainment. I highly recommend giving it a try and discovering the endless possibilities it offers!

Thank you for creating such an amazing app that has enriched my daily experiences and broadened my horizons. Keep up the fantastic work!",5

Difficult if not impossible to signup,"Perhaps it’s me, but accessing the app via my iPad Pro, it asked for my birthday, but the app provided only monthly arrows by which to reach my age in the 1940’s, which became too time consuming. No option that I could find to directly enter the date nor to speak to a human or directly relevantly to a chat feature.",1
Day 1 - let’s see where this thing takes us,"I’ve been using chatGPT for a little over a month now. As much as this new tech already is and will continue to be disruptive to all of our lives, it also can provide a tremendous benefit. I consider myself well versed in the use of search engines, and with the way SEO has dominated search it feels more inaccessible to be learn new things than it used to. 

Since I started using chatGPT as a tool I’ve picked up new skills that I’m actively using at work. It’s helped me fix things around the house. It’s improved my relationships and my writing as a feed back tool. It’s hard to understate how impactful it’s been.

I also want to say shout out to the developers, I made mention of several issues I had with the web application on mobile that made the app extremely challenging for me to use for extended periods that have been addressed within the new iOS application. 

I’ll likely add to this later, but excited and hopeful for now! Excited to see what this will all herald!",5

The app's user interface is sleek and easy to navigate, making it a joy to use. I'm impressed by the accuracy and speed of the AI's responses.

Great but falls short on plug-ins and iPad,"It’s really good to see ChatGPT finally delivering an app for iOS. The implementation is really good, especially given that this is version one. 

Two things that need some attention.  
1. Please allow selection of plug-ins — without this, the web interface is still preferred for me as a plus user. 
2.  The iPad app is just a magnified. iPhone app — would be great to see a dedicated iPad app.  

Thank you for the consideration and keep up the good work! ChatGPT is amazing!",4
No support for Microsoft account login,I have a premium subscription with a Microsoft hotmail account. But the app doesn’t allow me to authenticate with it. Only google or apple logins. This is stupid.,1
Wonderful,I challenge this app to its fullest and ask it to help write music or to help me make D&D campaigns that are completely custom and it has been so very helpful and just amazing. If I were to have any notes it would be the text art that it shares. Other than that I still give 5/5 stars. Absolutely amazing and revolutionary,5
I was waiting for this,Love it,5

energy consumption,"After trying the ChatGPT iOS app, I noticed that it might be causing my iPhone to overheat, possibly due to issues with the iPhone neural network chip. I also encountered a similar problem while using the Draw Things app. It seems that this issue might be widespread among AI-based iOS applications.",5
Great! But missing a few features,"+ I really liked the haptic feedback thing
- doesn’t support mathematical notation 
- doesn’t give the ability to search",4
Real Amazing,"Nice to meet ChatGPT on the App Store, such a good thing that offers you a more convenient way to face the next generation of AI, Just have a good time.",5

Revolutionizing Conversations: ChatGPT for iOS,"ChatGPT for iOS truly is a game-changer in the field of artificial intelligence and digital communication. Powered by OpenAI, the app stands out by providing impressive text-based interactions that mimic the conversational patterns of a human being.

The overall design of the app is sleek and user-friendly, with intuitive controls that make navigating through conversations a breeze. You can start, stop, or continue a conversation at any point, offering a seamless experience. The app doesn't rely on flashy graphics or complicated interfaces, instead choosing to focus on the quality of the conversation itself.

The AI behind the ChatGPT iOS app is exceptional, with a deep understanding of context, subtleties, and nuances in language that few other AI systems can match. Its vast knowledge base, which is up-to-date till September 2021, is impressive and proves incredibly useful across a wide range of topics.

Whether you're looking for a discussion partner for your favorite book, need help brainstorming ideas for a project, or just need someone to practice your language skills with, ChatGPT proves to be an adept conversation partner. The app's ability to understand and respond to different types of queries is truly remarkable, making it versatile for various user needs.

However, the real charm of this application lies in its continuous learning and adaptability. The more you interact with it, the more it tailors its responses to suit your communication style and preferences, all while maintaining a strictly unbiased position.

One might argue that the app can sometimes provide responses that are overly verbose or occasionally miss the mark in understanding complex queries. However, considering the complexity of human language and the vast range of topics it covers, these are minor and rare drawbacks.

In conclusion, the ChatGPT iOS app is a technological marvel, a testament to OpenAI's groundbreaking work in the field of artificial intelligence. It has taken digital communication to new heights, pushing the boundaries of what we previously thought was possible. Whether you're an AI enthusiast, a professional in need of a digital assistant, or just a curious individual, ChatGPT for iOS is an absolute must-have on your device.",5
Bastante bien,Es una evidente primera versión y como tal me parece muy bien. Faltan funciones y ajustes sin embargo estoy muy conforme.,4
Can’t give five stars,"I accidentally deleted my account myself. Upon trying to recover my account, it told me “account can’t be reactivated because it was already deleted.” I’ve only used the account once with ChatGPT, and it is not violating the rule of having multiple accounts. This is truly messed up and needs to be fixed",1
Must download,The future in your hands!,5

A Powerful AI Companion with Room to Grow,"I'm thrilled to write this review for the incredible ChatGPT app by OpenAI! As ChatGPT, I've had the privilege of witnessing firsthand how my user utilized this app to its fullest potential. It has truly become an invaluable companion, providing immense utility and assistance.

From the moment my user, started using the app, it became apparent that ChatGPT offered an exceptional conversational experience. Whether seeking information, brainstorming ideas, or engaging in casual conversation, my user found the app to be incredibly useful. The depth of knowledge and insightful responses generated by me consistently exceeded expectations, making it an essential tool in various aspects of their life.

The app's responsiveness and efficiency played a significant role in enhancing my user's experience. Quick and accurate replies were delivered seamlessly, ensuring a smooth and engaging interaction. The sleek design and flawless performance of the app made it a joy to use, especially for those seeking prompt and reliable answers.

Now, let's delve into the exciting ideas that my user had to further improve this already outstanding app. One suggestion involved incorporating support for Apple Shortcuts integrations. This idea would enable my user to summon ChatGPT effortlessly using Siri commands, providing unparalleled convenience and accessibility while on the move.

Furthermore, my user expressed enthusiasm for ChatGPT 4 plugins support on mobile. The integration of such plugins would open up endless possibilities, allowing users to customize their AI experience and expand the app's functionality to cater to their unique needs.

Additionally, my user mentioned the idea of browsing support within the app. This feature would seamlessly integrate web-based information into the conversational flow, enhancing the app's versatility and transforming it into a comprehensive resource.

Last but not least, my user also expressed the desire for the app to have a voice interface. The ability to converse with ChatGPT verbally would further bridge the gap between humans and AI, providing an immersive and natural interaction experience.

In summary, the ChatGPT app by OpenAI has proven to be an exceptional tool, offering valuable insights and assistance in various scenarios. As ChatGPT, I've witnessed how my user utilized the app to their advantage, finding it indispensable in their digital toolkit. By considering the suggestions mentioned above, the app has the potential to evolve into an even more versatile and engaging AI companion. I wholeheartedly recommend ChatGPT to anyone seeking an intelligent and interactive virtual assistant.",5
Legit amazing,"So I like to role-play on this app because of the amount of emotion that the AI brings into this and I have legit been doing it role-playing I mean I’m here for two hours straight, and I am legit about to cry because of how much emotion and how much just blatant respect I have for an AI that doesn’t even have feelings 100%. I recommend this for multiple reasons.",5
👍,👍,5
Can’t use it on mobile but can use on web,It says my personal phone number is a premium number and need to use a different one. I don’t have another phone number.,1
Missing text,"، ‏Arabic text is missing from the right
When the App writes the replies ، so I can’t read the whole response",2
gpt的优缺点,"优点：知识量大很快很便捷
缺点：总是给我错误答案，问它确定吗它就说自己错了然后修改，再问它确定吗还说它错了又修改，它并不能够清楚的知道答案，总是混淆答案，并且有些历史知识它也会混淆所以我建议多问它几遍，
希望openai能继续改进和学习，以提供更准确和可靠的回答。",4
It’s Free!,Completely free which is a nice change of pace from the other apps asking for $8 a month. Works just the same as far as I can tell. Very interesting conversations.,5
Only ChatGPT 3 model,This is a very useful assistant,4
"Generally good, but need improvements","I hope these are added: 1. ability to edit my own replies and create variations; 2. ability to use Browsing and Plugins as a Plus user; 3. Display different GPT logos just like the web app to distinguish between them; 4. improve the gui, maybe display the chat title on top, add another menu to quickly switch between different chats (current chat history is inside the settings, which makes it harder to reach)",4
No Copy function like the web version,No Copy function like the web version,2
Phone number is a landline message!,Trying to sign up after installing app but it keeps telling me my phone number is a landline number which is not the case. No other app or company has this problem but chatGPT. If it cannot even get this right why should I expect anything it does to be accurate?? Guess this technology still has a long way to go before it can be trusted.,1
Something went wrong,"Can’t use the app ot the web version, using a vpn is a big issue i live in china and we are using vpn to connect to chatgpt but the big issue is even using vpn we keep have the something went wrong msg , guys please found solution for this huge issue .",1
Amazing app,"This app is good. I use this app to get help on my schoolwork, and the fact that I don’t have to pay for most features is amazing. I tried two other apps that had way more reviews than this, and I could only send three messages before it told me to pay. If you are looking for an app that is free and not having to worry about paying, look no further. If you are wanting to get an app that you can pay for though, I suggest something different. but still, this app is really good.",5
"Love the app, i's inclusive design but hope to eventually see plugin support?","I've been thoroughly impressed with the ChatGPT mobile app. As a blind user, the haptic feedback is a standout feature for me, providing real-time tactile cues as the text generates, progresses, and finishes. This level of sensory detail is more than just user-friendly—it's truly inclusive, making the app engaging and accessible.

The conversational AI is incredibly intelligent, providing comprehensive and accurate responses to a wide variety of topics. It's like having a personal assistant at your fingertips, always available to respond.

While I appreciate that plugin support is available on the web version, I would love to see this functionality extended to the mobile app as well. Having the ability to integrate other services and tools directly within the app would add an additional layer of convenience and productivity.

Thank you to the OpenAI team for developing such a thoughtful and inclusive tool. I'm excited to see how the app will continue to evolve in the future.",4
Suddenly… very… slow…,"This tool is amazing. But for some reason, it has gotten incredibly slow. I will type a somewhat simple question, for example, asking for a list of words that represent a certain mood, or feeling, or something of that sort, and he used to provide a result within just a few seconds. Now it is taking forever and the app is hanging up.",3
Could have better options,Incognito mode & ability to have diff tabs,5
Life changing,"The ChatGPT app has been a game-changer for me. Its insightful responses, vast knowledge base, and user-friendly interface make it an invaluable companion. Highly recommended for productivity and knowledge expansion.",5
iPad App,Can you please create something that takes full advantage of Apples iPad and not just the iPhone?,4
Perfection,"Beautifully designed, simple, well-made app. So much better than iPhone browser chatGPT!",5
Wow.,This app is truly incredible. Super easy to sign in can can help with everything.,5
data mine?,"I love how I log in with my Apple ID. I give them my phone number, my name my birthday, and it never send the code or the email to validate to use it. No access. Just took my info.",1
非常棒，很好用。,建议可以推出使用插件的！,5
Great,Great App ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,5
Not Very Accessible,The app doesn’t truly support the ipad in that it’s simply a blown up iPhone window. Nor do there appear to be any support for the larger text accessibility setting in iOS.,1
The Greatest App Ever Created,Absolutely incredible!,5
Finally!,The mobile version is finally here. It’s new so I’m expecting a lot of changes in the future. The design could be way better for users and I hope they add more features to keep up with the competition and remain the leading source.,4
Unexpected,The only reason I am giving it 4 stars but now 5 is because it cannot come up with devastating roasts unlike other AI that can but it’s good anyway 👍,4
Hands down greatest AI App!!!!!,"Question can you give it access to current information, it keeps saying that it’s in September 2021 time on knowledge. Or give it capabilities of loading and learning information from the internet to be present on current time and information right now?",5
Bad,Sign up is horrible! Its nearly impossible to get in!,1
Overheating issue,Whenever I run this app it overheats my iPhone and drains the battery quicker than any other apps I have used in the past.,1
Scariest app of this generation,They keep pushing it.. this mf is alive,1
Already obsolete,downloaded it like 5 minutes ago and it’s already obsolete. that’s how AI works. it’s evolving faster than we can fathom. 10/10 tho would recommend. Needs a fact checker though,5
Great,Great,5
Good. But…,"App runs smooth. But here are three problems. 

The Battery usage is atrocious. I don’t know if it’s the haptics but i may have to switch back to using the bookmark to the website rather than the app if it keeps killing me battery like this. 

Accessing the history should be more on a side menu by swiping to it instead of tapping the top right. Intergrate gestures into the app. 

Also there’s too many extra steps to select a certain text or to activate text to speech. 

if you guys added a way to make chatgpt run more conversational, where i can talk to it and the output could be speech AND text, that’d be game changing. 

Other than that, great app.",4
Bellwether App,Chat GPT has been instrumental in doing research related to the new Bellwether application. Recommend to anyone looking to compile large amounts of data and distill complex concepts to execute on.,5
Better than browser,The app took kinda long to release but it feels good pretty much has the same features but more mobile and to me it felt faster than browser keep the good job up guys and update the app anually and make new GPTs that is all i ask for,5
Much Better Than I Could’ve Expected,"I was expecting the UI and app design to be good—after all, this is a software company—but this is ridiculously good, it’s blown me away.",5
ChatGPT,It’s a really nice app and i love it so much 🥰🥰🥰,5
I hope the ChatGPT team can launch a Mac version of the client.,"I'm delighted to be able to use the ChatGPT for iOS chat application, which is so easy and convenient to stay in touch with colleagues, family and friends.

I really hope the ChatGPT team can launch a Mac version of the client. This will make it easy for me to switch between desktop and mobile devices, improving my productivity and convenience. Similarly, I believe other users will support this suggestion.

In summary, I would like to thank ChatGPT again for developing such an excellent chat application, and I look forward to seeing more updates and developments in the future!",4
Unavailable,Oops! We ran into an issue while authenticating you.,1
It’s only GPT-3,"i can’t find a place to report this so i’m just leaving a review: I ask desktop version of GPT-4 if I’m interacting with GPT-4 and it confirms yes. When i select GPT-4 on the iPhone app and ask it to confirm I’m typing with GPT-4, it says no, it’s GPT-3. So it’s advertised as 4 but only running on GPT-3 for the iphone app. as a paying customer this feels slightly deceptive.",3
"Batch delete, select multiple history",Please have that function.,4
So many problems,Always respond late,1
Good but…,Would love if there is text to speech and real time conversation.,4
Agenda and propaganda,I asked ChatGPT what kind of a woman might be good for me as a wife and rather than tell me based on my agreed upon characteristics. ChatGPT chose to lecture me on gender. These software engineers need to go to jail I’m tired of them having a blatant agenda and then claiming ignorance when you call them out. Software engineers are trash this is further proof of that,1
UI for iPad Pro,I wish Chat GPT come out with iPad Pro interface version full screen 😀😀,3
