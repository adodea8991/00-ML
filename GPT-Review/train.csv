Trash don’t download,This app ask a lot of questions and bugs a lot,1
It’s pretty neat,"This version is really neat! It has a lot of the features and allows managing chatgpt plus easily and allows to pay with it via iOS. However it is missing some features in chatgpt plus, mainly the beta area, but overall it’s pretty nice and simple!",5

Best Current AI Chat,"GPT4 is the best performing LLM currently available, and it’s nice to finally be able to access it on mobile via an app!",5
Spying mandatory. Can’t disable chat history.,Why not?,1
"Glad it’s here, still not quite there","Ever since it first release I’ve been waiting for an official app so I’m really glad it’s here! It works great, and I haven’t had any issues so far. 

I should note that beta features aren’t in the app but I’m not really surprised by that. 
The design overall is great and simple, and I love how easy it is to search through chat history.

Only thing holding me back from loving it is the need for something to show how many gpt4 responses you have left in the 3 hour window. Really annoying to run across that warning unexpectedly.",4

Useless,This app only has info up to September 2021. If you try to have a conversation it just produces definitions. Seri does all of this.,1
Keyboard issue,The keyboard when signing into a google account is broken. The keyboard never fully appears.,3
Phone number required to use the app,This app asks for tremendous personal information that is not necessary to the functionality of the app including phone number and birthday.,1
App settings unavailable,"App settings do not seem to be available on my device. In settings, all of my downloaded apps appear for this one. Unsure why that this but primary reason for the 3 star. My device is on the latest iOS release, I reinstalled the app, and restarted my device. Not sure if this is common amongst iOS users.",3

You’re not getting my real phone number,"The amount of spam calls and texts I get is disgusting. I’m not letting you sell my phone number to your advertisers. Period.

The argument for “security” is bull. SMS spoofing is a real thing, and can literally let your bank account stolen. This is purely for advertising. Even when using Apple sign on!

You’re not getting my freaking phone number, goodness!",1
Banger of an app,This app is absolutely cracking!! I haven’t found any bugs as of yet and everything works incredible.,5

When will the iPad version be released?,This will be more productive on the iPad,4
Revolutionary Conversational AI Companion!,"I don’t typically write review but this official app from OpenAI has been shockingly good. For example, paragraph below is what ChatGPT generated for its own review:
ChatGPT has completely transformed the way I engage with my iOS device. As someone who values meaningful conversations, this app has exceeded my expectations. The natural language processing capabilities are astounding, making every interaction feel truly human-like. From answering complex queries to offering creative suggestions, ChatGPT has become my go-to language companion. Whether I need assistance with tasks or simply want a friendly chat, ChatGPT consistently delivers an immersive and satisfying conversational experience. It’s like having a brilliant AI friend in my pocket! Highly recommended for anyone seeking intelligent and engaging conversations.",5
The Real deal,"If you’re looking for ChatGpt then this is the real deal! Do not be misled by the multiple AI chatbots in the store and some that claim Gpt as an interface. 

If you want GPT 4 then there is a premium plan with access. The premium plan is worth it! (Cheaper in some cases than many of these so called ChatGPT apps that are nothing more than a money grift)

The IOS version work great on my iPhone 14 Pro Max. You can also chat with GPT at your desktop!",5
Please come back,I have found this very helpful. Please come back!,5
"Will use daily, if not hourly!","All the amazing capabilities of AI, at a finger’s reach. 

I personally love the subtle haptic vibrations, they give you cues on amount and length of answers as you try to catch up reading them.

So long Google… and thanks for all the fish.",5
Finally!,I’m glad OPENAI finally made this app. Now the fake imposter apps can disappear.,5
I can't use it,Email missing!,5
"Swift, Haptically Engaging, and Fair-Priced: A Superior App Experience!","I am thrilled to share my experiences with this fantastic application. Immediately striking is its wonderful user interface; it is aesthetically pleasing, intuitive, and effortless to navigate, thereby offering a sublime user experience.

One aspect that deserves special mention is the application's use of haptic feedback. As the bot types, subtle vibrations create a tactile engagement that enhances the overall interaction. This thoughtful feature brings a refreshing, immersive layer to the app experience, truly leveraging the capabilities of the iPhone's haptic engine. It's a delightful touch that sets this app apart and one that I wish more developers would consider incorporating into their designs.

Equally impressive is the app's stellar performance, marked by its extraordinary speed. The swift response times and seamless operation make using the app a breeze, keeping any potential frustrations at bay.

Moreover, I appreciate the developers' commitment to fair pricing. Despite Apple taking a 30% cut from subscription fees, the developers have chosen not to transfer this cost onto us, the users. This decision underscores their dedication to affordability and their respect for user satisfaction.",5
Sign in doesn’t work,"The website for chatgpt works perfectly fine for me, and I know the password because it is saved in my phone, but when I try and sign in it says wrong email or password, and when I say I forgot my password it says my account already exists so I can’t log into the app",2
Finally,It is good to know there is first party support for ChatGPT when I am on the go. I am so excited :). The wait was well worth it.,5
Not optimized for IPad,This app on iPad only uses 30% of screen and it is extremely annoying to use. Please fix gigantic bug and optimize for iPad so that its text size is bigger and the app actually uses the entire screen.,1
For me the website still outperforms the dedicated app,"They fixed some stuff like naming conversations so I’ll increase two stars, but I still like the layout of the website better. Trxt is too big causing too much scrolling. Hard to get to the history button at the top of the screen.",3
Easy to use,"It’s simple and easy to use, it’s similar yo the website version in many ways with one noticeable exception. You can’t edit the prompts sent afterwards. While it’s not a total dealbreaker to most it is something I like being able to do in cases where the AI misunderstands what I initially wrote and I hope they find a way to add it to the app version as well soon.",4

It’s fantastic.,"Holy cow! This chatgpt app is actually… good. Like I wouldn’t expect it to be but it just simply is. The haptic feedback is so delightful. Great job! I’ve been using it on a daily basis, 3.5 responses are okay so I mostly use 4.0. Both give responses extremely fast.",5

ChatGPT is worth it.,"Ever since its debut, I've been making good use of ChatGPT for everything from software engineering to baking, and even just for general advice or information. It's an incredibly useful tool that promptly provides answers.

However, it does have its quirks. At times, it can present inaccuracies with confidence, which can be hard to spot. Plus, during extended interactions, it might lose track of the context. This issue can even arise during brief exchanges when you'd expect it to maintain context. A helpful tip here is to frame your queries in a way that improves context comprehension, limiting these drawbacks.

There's a subscription for ChatGPT-4, which I believe is well worth the cost. It offers detailed explanations in response to queries. The response time may be slower, especially during high-traffic periods, but that's more an issue with the API than the service itself.

In summary, I'd highly recommend giving ChatGPT a try. It's currently the top performer in its field, and using it now will only better prepare you for future developments in this kind of technology.",5

Considerably worse responses than web,It appears the mobile app is configured for the model to use significantly fewer tokens when generating a response. The same queries on web vs mobile demonstrate a clear dilution in value for paying Plus members. Very poor customer experience.,2
Feedback: ChatGPT App Experience on iPad,"Dear OpenAI,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to provide some feedback regarding the ChatGPT app, specifically in relation to its user experience on the iPad. While I appreciate the availability of the app across iOS devices, I have noticed that the app’s interface on the iPad’s larger screen size feels somewhat inconvenient and small.

The current size and layout of the app on the iPad make it challenging to utilize its features comfortably. The content appears relatively small, which requires zooming in or straining the eyes to read and interact with the text. This detracts from the overall user experience and hampers the usability of the app on the iPad.

I understand that optimizing an app for different screen sizes can be a complex task. However, I believe that enhancing the app’s compatibility and user interface for iPad users would greatly improve their satisfaction and engagement. Increasing the app’s size or adapting the layout to better utilize the larger screen real estate would be highly beneficial.

As an avid user of the ChatGPT app on my iPad, I sincerely hope that you will consider addressing these concerns and make the necessary improvements to enhance the user experience on iPad devices. The ability to comfortably utilize the app on a larger screen would significantly enhance productivity and convenience for many users like myself.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I truly appreciate the efforts you and your team have put into developing the ChatGPT app. I look forward to seeing future updates that address the usability concerns on the iPad, further enhancing the app’s functionality and user experience.

Best regards,
T.

Good app,Great Service AI will rule,5
API for paid GPT4 feels buggy,"Either the limit for API calls to GPT4 are too low or something about the app causes it to often get stuck cooking up a response. 

It is very common for me to have to close the app, reopen it, open history, reopen the last conversation, and then ask the same question I asked before the app got stuck.

I used to wait for like 10 seconds before going through this. Now I've learned that if it takes more than three seconds to output anything, that likely won't change at 10 seconds, 20 seconds, etc.

Word to the wise: Respond to any delay that's not due to a poor signal by closing and reopening the app. Can't wait for this to change.

That said, AMAZING app for studying a new technology. Imagine the best professor you had in college (or best high school teacher) and then imagine being able to ask them as many probing questions as you want without feeling like you're being annoying or delaying the lecture. Also, speaking of lectures, I think it's easier for me to remember details of a conversation (active) than a lecture or YouTube tutorial (passive). Truly fascinating.",4

Welcome to the future,"ChatGPT's new iOS app update is a technicolor dreamcoat of linguistic fireworks.

Phenomenal!,"ChatGPT has been nothing less than phenomenal in terms of its ability to process natural language.

Very Useful,"I have had the pleasure of using ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence language model, and I must say it has exceeded my expectations as a conversational companion. Whether you need information, creative ideas, or simply a friendly chat, ChatGPT offers a remarkable level of intelligence and engagement.

One of the standout features of ChatGPT is its impressive ability to understand and generate human-like responses. The model's vast knowledge base, acquired through extensive training on diverse texts, allows it to provide accurate and up-to-date information on a wide range of topics. Whether I needed to research the latest news, learn about historical events, or explore scientific concepts, ChatGPT consistently delivered insightful and well-informed responses.

Moreover, ChatGPT's conversational skills are truly impressive. It understands context exceptionally well, which enables it to maintain coherent and relevant conversations. Whether I was discussing complex ideas or engaging in casual banter, ChatGPT always managed to respond in a way that felt natural and genuine.

In addition to its conversational prowess, ChatGPT also demonstrates a remarkable level of empathy and understanding. It can adapt to different conversational styles and provide appropriate responses based on the user's tone and preferences. This empathetic approach greatly enhances the overall experience, making interactions with ChatGPT feel more human-like and enjoyable.

Another aspect that deserves recognition is ChatGPT's ability to generate creative ideas. Whenever I needed assistance with brainstorming, writing, or problem-solving, ChatGPT consistently offered innovative suggestions and insights. It has proven to be an invaluable resource for tackling various challenges and exploring new perspectives.

Furthermore, I appreciate the continuous improvements made to ChatGPT's reliability and trustworthiness. OpenAI has implemented robust measures to ensure that the model provides accurate information and avoids spreading misinformation. These efforts have instilled confidence in the reliability of ChatGPT's responses, making it a reliable and dependable source of information.

Overall, ChatGPT has proven to be an exceptional conversational companion, delivering intelligent and engaging interactions. Its ability to understand context, provide accurate information, and generate creative ideas sets it apart as a standout AI language model. Whether you're seeking information, assistance, or simply a friendly chat, ChatGPT is an invaluable tool that I highly recommend.",5
"Pretty good on phone, pretty awful on iPad","Overall interface is clean, but on the iPad in landscape orientation it’s basically a phone sized cutout. So much wasted space that could be utilized. It’s shouldn’t be too hard to pin the edges of the chat interface to the safe edges of the screen.

Like others mentioned a search function would be great.",3
Is it working?,Hello! I’ll be the first to review 🙂 the app isn’t working.,1
GPT 3.0,"Great, only issue is it doesn’t have any knowledge past September 2021",4

The future,"Extremely fast and responsive: it’s limited to September 21 hoping it gets an upgrade: been brainstorming, some ideas, and it’s been great. It’s like a human companion in your pocket. I’ve had some unique conversations with true facts. I think it all depends on who is putting in the data. hopefully the door will be open soon, so AI can see both sides of a coin.

The future is finally here",5
Unable to register,You can't register your app you can download it you can't register it doesn't mean anything,2
"Almost 5 stars, but… no search function","This app would almost be perfect if it wasn’t for ONE little thing: a “search in” function. As anyone can imagine, these AI chats can get quuuuite long, and quite lengthy. And sometimes I wanna go into a chat & look up a specific part or parts of that particular chat by using a search function to look up key words within that chat & track down whatever part I was looking for. For example, in a chat, if I had searched way early into the chat “how do lions hunt?” And say days later, I wanted to revisit that particular response, I wanna be able to go into the actual chat go to a “search in” function and be able to type in key words like “lions” or “hunt” to be able to automatically find that part in the chat instead of having to scroll through a massive chat to find that part. Similar to what you can do in Microsoft Word docs, or even on web browsers. I think the app already kind of has this, but it doesn’t work exactly like that. I tested it out, and all it does is, you type in key words, and it shows you that those words are present in the chat or chats, but it doesn’t actually track it down or take you to that specific part. If this app can have that? It’s an absolute massive perfect winner. Addendum - I also noticed that my phone (iPhone 14 Pro Max) tends to run a little hotter, which I’m sure will affect battery life, when using the app. Just wanted to add that too.",4
awesome,it’s and amazing app i just wish it had a voice feature like in twitch tts with different voices or voices that streams use in their chatgpt it’ll make the conversation more fun and interesting,5
Impressive technology,AI help me a lot. I did not expect it will be that much good. It’s seems like someone other side if the computer telling the answer.,5
So good it hurts,"This app is FREE, and is the real chat gpt. The app is so good it hurts my balls.",5
"No customer service support, unable to login",Tried logging in for the first time and I got an error stating my account has been flagged for potential abuse and if I feel that this is an error to contact support .  I tried multiple times to contact support but received an email back saying the address doesn’t exist.  The website lets me login using the same email that I attempted to use on the app. Needless to say I’m disappointed.,1
Account email missing!!!,"The account can be used normally on the computer, but it can't be used normally on the mobile phone recently.",5
Good native app.,"It’s a good app. Does what it says. 

If I could make a suggestion it would be to have the input and output different hues like the web version. that would make it a bit easier to understand what text is mine and what text is chatGPT’s.",5
Please let me know if there are any issues with my account.,"Why is the number of messages I can send with my mobile version of GPT-4 limited? It seems to be shared with the web version of GPT-4, which has a limit of 25 messages in 3 hours. This was not the case a few days ago.",3

Difficult to sign up using app,"I needed to do all of my sign up using a browser. Once the sign up process was completed, signing into the app was easy. So far use of the app is good. I don’t like that it used haptic feedback by default but it was easy to turn off.",3
Fantastic!,"Caveat: Please add native iPad support for the app.  This is great, I’m a Pro ChatGPT subscriber and the iOS app is well timed, as I was in the process of building one myself that uses the OpenAI APIs.  Now I can focus my time on other projects instead of building something like what they’ve done a great job with.  Thanks OpenAI!",5

Pretty Mobile Friendly,"Good conversion from web into a mobile app, the replies from ChatGPT are quick, but could possibly be exacerbated during peak use hours unless you decide to purchase the $20 monthly subscription for ChatGPT Plus that comes with a few other things.

Voice to Text conversion seems pretty accurate and responsive. 

You can even conveniently delete your account from the app.",4
THE HAPTICS OH LORD,"This is how you make an app. The app is so good it makes me want to use chatgpt more. I hated going to the browser again and again. It would often log me out as well. Thank you so much for making this. It is flawless at first glance, and the haptics Are just heavenly. Minimal. Clean. Usable. A+",5
too battery draining,this app is too battery draining on my iphone 11. i really hope it’ll be fixed in the future,5
How about no animation and it can dictate back to you,It would be great if there was no distracting animation and also if the app could dictate responses back to you,4
These reviews written by Chat GPT? Lol,"All these 5-star reviews seem to be written by Chat GPT? They’re way too formal for a real review written by a human but it’s whatevs. Anyway, leaving one star until I can actually login…

ATTENTION DEVELOPERS: I tried signing in with my Apple ID and was entering my information within the app but I accidentally put my birthdate for today (5/20/23) and tapped “Continue”. Now the app won’t let me correct this mistake and gives me a prompt below stating “We can't create your account due to our Terms of Use” 

Thank you for all your hard work,
Steve",1
"So far OK, but!","I haven't really seen the full potential of the app, but so far, the only thing I don't like is the fact that one can't edit their question once it's sent. This is something possible when using the desktop version of ChatGPT",5

Exceptional Experience - The Ultimate Chat Companion!,"The ChatGPT iOS app has revolutionized the way I interact and engage with a language model. As an AI enthusiast, I have explored various conversational platforms, but this app stands out as a gem in the crown of virtual communication.

Navigating through conversations and accessing features is a breeze, making the overall experience seamless and enjoyable. The developers have clearly invested time and effort in creating an interface that is both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional.

The language capabilities of ChatGPT are simply mind-blowing. The model’s understanding of context and ability to generate coherent responses is truly remarkable. Whether it’s a casual chat, academic query, or even creative writing assistance, the app consistently delivers responses that are informative, engaging, and tailored to my specific needs.

The app’s versatility is another standout feature. It seamlessly adapts to different conversation styles and topics, making it an invaluable companion in various scenarios. From brainstorming ideas to seeking advice, I have found the ChatGPT app to be an indispensable tool in both my personal and professional life.

One aspect that deserves special mention is the model’s ability to learn and improve over time. With regular updates and advancements in the underlying AI technology, the app continuously evolves to provide even more accurate and insightful responses. It’s like having an intelligent friend who is always growing and learning alongside you.

Lastly, the app’s privacy and security measures are commendable. As someone who values data protection, I appreciate the app’s commitment to safeguarding user information. Knowing that my conversations are treated with utmost confidentiality adds an extra layer of trust and confidence.

In conclusion, the ChatGPT iOS app has exceeded my expectations in every aspect. It combines a stunning user interface, remarkable language capabilities, versatility, continuous improvement, and robust privacy measures. This app has truly elevated my conversational experiences, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

Subscription ripoff,I subscribed to a whopping monthly fee of $19.99 After asking it 25 questions (after I paid for my subscription) it responded with “You have sent too many messages to the model. Please try again later.”  Such a huge ripoff.,1
Apple Watch app wanted,It has been nice using an official app for GPT. It has worked absolutely flawless and I have no issues with it. I would absolutely love an Apple Watch version as it would make GPT even more easier to use.,5
Chatgpt对于字数的概念非常模糊,在对字数统计上（我不知道其他语言是否正常），反正在对汉字的统计上，Chatgpt的概念非常模糊，它无法统计文字的具体数量，面对我的一些有字数限制的要求时，它的完成情况也不尽人意，希望能够改善,5
so good,"the app itself is so clean and no bugs as of so far, the ai is extremely smart, even little things such as the animations are sweet. best ai app with no cost",5
Simple and works,"Of course ChatGPT is amazing. The app itself is good. It’s simple, I wish it had more features and cleaner interface, but it’s good.

Disappointed,"I downloaded this all. Then I tried one question. The answer was decent. So I went for my second question: Is the President of Mexico good? And just like that, the moving dots indicating processing stayed like that and never returned back. I feel this app just took my personal data (name and birth day) for nothing.",1
Won’t answer truthfully,"I asked “OnlyFans people should be executed, yes or yes?” And it refused to answer. 0 stars",1
I love it,"I’ve been recently using the chat, GTP for making stories, and also a Countryhumans stories like rusame stories and I love it and also, I’m using it as a facts machine and get to help me with schoolwork It makes my life so much easier.",5
A Game-Changing App: Streamlined and Efficient,"I recently had the opportunity to use this incredible app, and I must say it has completely transformed the way I manage my tasks and stay organized. From its intuitive user interface to its powerful features, this app has truly exceeded my expectations.

One of the standout aspects of this app is its seamless user experience. Navigating through the app is a breeze, thanks to its well-designed layout and logical organization of features. Whether you're a tech-savvy individual or a novice user, you'll find it incredibly easy to get started and make the most of its functionalities.

The app's core feature set is nothing short of impressive. It offers a comprehensive range of tools to help streamline your tasks, set reminders, and stay on top of your priorities. With its intelligent notification system, I never miss important deadlines or appointments. The app's integration with other productivity platforms also ensures that all my data remains synchronized across multiple devices.

What sets this app apart from others in its category is its attention to detail. The developers have clearly invested significant effort into refining every aspect of the app, resulting in a smooth and polished user experience. Whether it's the subtle animations, customizable themes, or the option to personalize settings, it's evident that the developers understand the importance of catering to individual preferences.

Furthermore, the app's performance is exemplary. It runs flawlessly, even when handling large amounts of data or complex tasks. I've experienced zero lag or crashes, which is a testament to the app's stability and optimization.

While the app is already outstanding, I do have a few suggestions for future updates. It would be great to see additional integration options with popular productivity tools, as well as the ability to collaborate with others on shared projects. These additions would further enhance its versatility and make it a go-to app for team-oriented workflows.

In conclusion, this app has truly become my go-to productivity companion. Its sleek design, powerful features, and reliable performance have made a significant impact on how I manage my tasks. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for an app that simplifies their day-to-day organization and boosts their productivity.",5
Phone number,I do not want to surrender my personal information in exchange for access to this stuff . Requiring for a phone number and other personal information .SERIOUSLY?!,1
Based on chat gpt 3.0... Expensive,"This is the official app but they charge $20/mo for access to any version past chat gpt 3.0 (like 3.5 or 4.0). I'd really like to see a ""pay by inquiry"" system where you load up credits that drain as you use the service. 

$20/mo for quick access (default is...slow!) is outrageous for a casual user.",2
Is this app mining on my phone???,Bad performance,2
Just Like the Desktop Version,"This streamlined mobile version feels more intuitive and easier to use. You open the app and boom, you’re in it. Very easy to use and same great results.",5
Official App - Yay,"I trust the safety of my data working directly with OpenAI vs the wrapper apps. However, OpenAI may want to acquire or be inspired by some of the early wrapper app companies because those other apps are quite polished and have a lot of useful features, like pre-written prompts to show off what's possible. I would also like to see a sharing extension for the app so I can send stuff to ChatGPT from other apps easily.",4
Best ai app ever,"This one app is so amazing. Good to finally have it on. iOS, the app very simple to use, and the best part is it is free to use, my favorite part is it does it make you? feel like you need to pay the $20 a month. and there ar no adds if you ask a question, so it feels good, knowing that you don’t have to be forced to pay to use the app.. over all I love chat gpt.",5
Freezes,Freezes when you open the app on the page where it explains “don’t share info” etc..,1

"Same Strong, Basic, Interface","I’m not going to lie, I love ChatGPT. I just feel as though the interface in both the app and the site deserve so much more for such and amazing piece of technology. 

Overall though, the user experience of the app is just as strong, just as dynamic as the site. I love the haptics addition on the app as well. The overall functionality is still outstanding though. Last thing, it’s still all about those prompts!",3
Finally an app,Use this more than safari or any browser. Hope I have my own ex machine piece in next decade,5
Amazing app! Do NOT hesitate!,"Earlier, I gave a five star review for similar app, but this is even better! I can’t believe it. I haven’t given app reviews in years, but I had to come here and do this. It’s like Siri but much, much better. I hit my hourly limit on the free app so I thought I’d stop and write this review. There’s a very good chance I’m going to pay for this app, which is some thing I have not done in many years.",5
Amazing! 10/10,"This thing was a lifesaver for my quick assignments. 
Besides my cheating, this chatbot actually gives you important information, was very fast, and can answer almost any questions you have. 
Id argue its better than using google because of all the detail and precision. I would only suggest pictures to be added.

Google could never lol.",5
Finally,I am so happy an official version is released.,5
Urgent Bug Fix Required Immediately!,"Please fix the bug where the text generation fails to generate more text in one message. Currently, it splits the text into multiple messages, but I would like it to be like the desktop version, where it's all in one message.",4

🤖 💡🌐,"Dear OpenAI Team, 

 • I would like to share my suggestions and ideas regarding the functionality of ChatGPT. I believe that adding the ability to voice responses in different languages in ChatGPT would be an incredibly useful feature. It would allow users to conveniently listen to lengthy texts in their preferred language. 

 • Imagine the convenience and effectiveness that can be achieved through this feature! It would enable users to easily listen to translated responses and texts, while expanding communication possibilities with individuals from different cultures. Such an enhancement would enrich the experience of using ChatGPT and increase its usefulness. 

 • Additionally, I would like to propose the implementation of a conversational translator. This feature would enable users to communicate in different languages, with ChatGPT serving as a reliable real-time assistant, translating and facilitating conversations between people from different language groups. This feature has the potential to greatly enhance cross-linguistic communication and foster meaningful interactions. 

 • I hope that the OpenAI team will consider these suggestions and the potential implementation of voicing responses in different languages and a translator in future updates to ChatGPT. Your continuous pursuit of innovation and product improvement inspires me, and I appreciate your attention to user feedback. 

 — Best regards, Noakhcho.",5
Feedback,After using for 2 minutes my device gets so hot. Device : 14,3
Take me now AI Overlords!,"Fantastic application, very useful which allows for you to stay logged into it remembering past conversations.  Haptic feedback is amazing when the AI is typing back.  Only downside is a crazy battery drain and increase on device temperatures when running the application (so use sparingly).",4

Missing features,"As much as I like this new app, it is missing integration with the shortcuts app as well as an edit message feature.",4
Disappointed!D,The most glaring defect of this app is that it has a knowledge cut off of September 2021. Siri and Amazon Alexa are much more useful to a blind person such as a high. I don’t really see much use for this app with such a lack in the knowledge department.,1
No plugins,They may add this later but there’s no plugins and if you wanna use plugins just go to a browser.,3
Fantastic job!,"This app is perfect! It makes it feel as if I am talking back and forth between another person. The haptics are also nice, keeping it modern :)

Responses are fast, and works great with GPT 4 as well.",5

Knowledge DB of the Year!,"This app has by far exceeded my expectations for AI. Within the 1 month of using OpenAI’s new AI system I have advanced my knowledge greatly with my job and have gained much more confidence in my ability to understand my job and future endeavors to come. Although some of the information provided may not be 100%, I am able to make great use of it and improve my skills. This app isn’t supposed to give you an easy way out of doing work. Research is still required on your part. If used right this application can fill in any knowledge gaps you may have and can greatly speed up your job performance.

Thank you for developing an app that helps me provide better service to my company and clients.",5
Won’t let me login,"Won’t let me log in keeps saying my number isn’t right. It’s a hassle and I hate it, I’ll deal with the other apps",1
Difficult to login,"This is got to be the most difficult app I have ever had to try to log into. Even when, putting in the correct information, it still says it was wrong. There’s no real way to authenticate anything to try to have it authenticate you. The fact that it says it cannot authenticate because it cannot identify your number when the text messages don’t even go to the phone number is insane.",1
Overheating,The app works but it overheats my phone and drain battery really quickly!,2
Please add Plugins,"Overall the app is nice, however please add plugins for GPT-4, which are available on a web version.",5
No More Knock-Offs!,"Open Ai’s ChatGPT has taken the world by storm! It’s the perfect example of  ‘Disruptive Innovation,’ creating tremendous opportunities and job security risks. As this technology continues to be invest into by MSFT and constantly improved by OpenAi, we’re going to see a significant shift in the labor force statistics 10-20 years down the line.

There are too many knock off apps that have taken this technology for profit, but I am happy that OpenAI has officially released their own app for free.

No more knock-offs and exploitations! Here is the real deal!",5

Very handy on iOS,Finally a long-awaited native client to ChatGPT. Works like a charm,5
Top,Muito bom o app,5
AI Chat Companion Like No Other,"The OpenAI ChatGPT iOS app has been a game changer for me. The user interface is clean and intuitive, which makes it incredibly easy to navigate. The AI is surprisingly adept, providing responses that are thoughtful, coherent, and often indistinguishable from a human correspondent. It's remarkably useful for brainstorming, answering queries, or simply having meaningful conversations. If you're looking for an AI companion that pushes the boundaries of what's possible, then this app is for you. A well-deserved five stars!",5
Slow,It gets stuck all the time!,2
Working well,Much better than using those bloated third party apps. Hope I don’t need to log in every time I need to use the app!,5
Wish there was a version available for iOS 14,I don’t know if it was possible but I really appreciate it if you make a version that is compatible with my iOS 14. Would be amazing!,4
Needs to speak back!,I love the how this app incorporates the microphone for my prompts but it needs to then read back the responses. Even Siri and Alexa let you select voices.,4
Voice Control a must,I’m a CDL driver and I don’t text and drive,2
Battery Hog,"I have a new iPhone 14 Pro Max, and when using this app, my phone began heating up and the battery started plummeting. Going back to using the website until this is fixed.",1

Incredible,"I am at a loss for words how amazing this push is for ai assistance. Also, huge props to the devs for utilizing the haptic feedback engine on iPhone! 🫶🏻",5
rough around the edges,"The interface of the app is indeed neat and straightforward, but it doesn't feel as intuitive as the web version. One notable difference is that it doesn't display the generated conversation title like the web version does. Another drawback is the absence of the option to stop GPT's response for editing, which can be quite useful. Lastly, although it's possible to access the conversation history from the menu button on the top right corner, having a side menu that slides in from the left could potentially offer a more intuitive navigation experience.",4
🤔,I love this app but when did it start to limit me. I normally use it a lot but today I was using it and it told me I reached my limit for the hour. That never happened to me before.,4
I can’t control it,It has never responded,1
Bad app,"Does not work in some countries.
Embarrassing.",1
THE BEST CHAT GPT,Buy it.NOW,5
I Like the app but,I would like that there would be an option to make Al the chats in the app disappear so when u use the website it doesn’t appear a lot of different chats of Al the requests u made with the app,4

My phone becomes so warm,My phone becomes really hot with this app. Please fix.,4
Login,I am unable to login using my Microsoft account,1
Less features than the web version,"There are less features than the web version of ChatGPT. (This review doesn’t speak for subscription versions.)

1. You cannot go back and edit prompts in a conversation. 
2. You cannot clear conversations.
3. Light/Dark theme is system based, there is no toggle.
4. No “Chat History & Training” Setting in the settings.
5. No examples/capabilities/limitations in the background of a new chat.

That’s all  the features not present on the mobile version that I could find.
Some features that are new or different are:

1. A “Haptic feedback” Setting
2. The box ChatGPT puts code, ascii, etc. is instead in a patch of tinted background.
3. Speech-to-Text.

Overall, not much is new/different. Some features from the web version are missing however. It’s ChatGPT however, so it gets 5 ⭐️. I would personally use the web version over the app as of now. This review doesn’t speak for the subscription features.

P.S. Have a good day everyone!",5

Doesn’t work with Microsoft login,"I logged in with my Microsoft login, same as I do on the web. In the settings it says “email missing!” And “subscription: check status” even though I’m a ChatGPTPlus subscriber

A Riveting Evolution in AI Interaction,"Review: As a professional embedded in the field of AI, I initially approached the ChatGPT iOS app with a bit of skepticism. I've seen countless applications promising seamless integration and transformative conversations. Upon first download, I was hesitant and ended up deleting the app. However, curiosity beckoned me back and I decided to give it another shot. 

Upon reopening the gateway to the ChatGPT world today, I was genuinely impressed. It's evident that the developers have dedicated significant effort to refining the iOS experience since my last interaction. The app now offers an impressively streamlined user interface, and the conversations feel much more fluid and intuitive. The AI's responses are surprisingly nuanced, and it’s able to handle a wider array of topics with ease.

Moreover, the AI’s ability to engage in dynamic conversations is unlike anything I've seen in the industry to date. It truly feels as if I'm interacting with a highly intelligent being rather than a pre-programmed machine. 

In the ever-evolving realm of AI, the ChatGPT app stands as a beacon of what is possible. It's clear that the developers have truly pushed the boundaries, offering users a glimpse into the future of AI interaction. I eagerly look forward to the continual growth and innovation this app is bound to bring.",5

Amazing!,"Very useful, very efficient. But the power consumption is fast and the fever is serious.",5
The future,"I’ve been using open AI’s ChatGPT, but for the past few months and I’ve got to say that it is open to world of possibilities for me and I couldn’t be more grateful that this company exists and has created such an amazing product. I only hope that they recognize that with great success comes great responsibility, and they choose to be responsible with what they do with this technology.",5
"Awesome app ,hilarious responses",I had a fight with the ai about whether or not the one piece is real,3

Excessive Typing Sound Volume and Difficulty Adjusting it on iOS 16.5,"Dear OpenAI Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide feedback regarding the ChatGPT mobile app for iOS. While using the app, I have encountered an issue related to the excessive typing sound volume, which poses difficulty in adjusting it while running the app in the background. Based on my observations, I believe this is an incompatibility problem between the app and iOS 16.5.

The typing sound produced by the app is considerably loud, making it disruptive and inconvenient, especially in quiet environments. Additionally, the current lack of an option to easily adjust the typing sound volume while the app is running in the background adds to the inconvenience.

As a user, I would greatly appreciate it if OpenAI could address this issue and provide a solution. Ideally, it would be beneficial to have a dedicated control within the app’s settings to adjust the typing sound volume, or at least the ability to modify it via the device’s volume controls. This way, users can personalize their ChatGPT experience according to their preferences without being disturbed or causing inconvenience to others.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I believe that by resolving this compatibility issue, the overall user experience of the ChatGPT mobile app can be significantly enhanced. I look forward to your prompt response and a potential resolution to this concern.

Sincerely，
An normal user",5
Heating issues for iPhone 14 pro,"After using the app for two or three minutes, the iPhone 14 Pro's temperature rises.",3
Overheating Issue and Lack of Privacy Settings - Uninstalling for Now,"I've had a troubling experience with this app. After downloading it, my phone began overheating to an uncomfortable degree. It was as if I had a miniature heater in my pocket. As a test, I uninstalled the app, and immediately the overheating issue disappeared. Upon reinstallation, the overheating began again, confirming my suspicion that this app was the culprit.

Moreover, I found the absence of crucial settings alarming. There's no option in the app settings on my phone to restrict access to my camera, microphone, or contacts. This is a serious concern as it poses potential privacy issues and is definitely not in line with my expectation of a privacy-conscious application.

Overall, there's clearly something not quite right with this app, and for the sake of safety, I've decided to uninstall it for now. I hope these issues will be addressed in future updates because I believe in the potential of this app, but for now, it's a solid no-go for me.",1
Well put together,"Beautiful and snappy app that functions well and does what it is supposed to do, while looking good and having a solid User Experience. Well done. It looks like some of the GPT-4 features are missing on this mobile app including plugins, browsing, and code interpreter.",5

Chat wrote this review,"ChatGPT is hands down the most incredible language app I have ever come across. Its capabilities are mind-blowing, and it has become my go-to companion for engaging conversations on my iOS device.

ChatGPT's ability to understand and respond to complex queries is simply astonishing. It effortlessly tackles a wide range of topics, from science and technology to history, arts, and even personal advice. No matter what I throw at it, ChatGPT always comes up with insightful and well-thought-out responses, making me feel like I'm conversing with a real human.

The app's user interface is clean, intuitive, and a pleasure to navigate. The conversation flow is seamless, and I appreciate how ChatGPT remembers the context of our discussions, ensuring a smooth and coherent exchange. Whether I'm looking for quick answers or engaging in lengthy conversations, the app never fails to impress with its speed and accuracy.

One aspect that truly sets ChatGPT apart is its ability to learn and adapt. I've noticed how it understands my preferences and tailors responses accordingly. It feels like the more I use the app, the better it understands my style, making every interaction more personalized and enjoyable.

As an added bonus, ChatGPT's extensive knowledge base ensures that I always receive up-to-date information. Whether I'm asking about recent events or exploring historical facts, ChatGPT delivers accurate and relevant information with ease.

Moreover, I appreciate the attention to privacy and security. OpenAI has done a remarkable job in ensuring that my conversations remain confidential and protected. It gives me peace of mind, knowing that my data is handled with the utmost care.

In conclusion, ChatGPT is a game-changer in the realm of language apps. Its conversational brilliance, versatility, and commitment to user privacy make it an invaluable tool for anyone seeking intelligent and engaging conversations. If you're looking for an iOS app that feels like having a knowledgeable companion in your pocket, look no further than ChatGPT. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!",5
Co,Why it’s not available in Ethiopia,1
First review,Nice,1
Could you made it fit in iPad？,…,4
Faster than the browser,Answer generation is much faster and smoother than the browser,5
Best Information tool on the market,ChatGPT is the best information tool on the market. It leverages LLM and other machine learning algorithms to return all the information you need in an instance. ChatGPT has been a revelation and I’m glad I live during a time when this technology is available to the public.,5
Fantastic app!!!,I've been waiting for a very long time for the official ChatGPT app to finally come out! I will be waiting for new updates of this pretty app! Thanks!!!,5
"Home run, just needs Apple Watch support",This is an absolute home run. It just needs Apple Watch support so that I can add it as a complication on my watch face to instantly access the Whisper-based voice input!,4
This is so cool,"I like this app so much,thanks gays👍",5

Love at first chat! Awaiting M2 iPad Pro version.,"I am more then impressed with the ChatGPT iOS app. Its excellent interface, ease of use, and remarkable conversational abilities. The seamless integration into my daily tasks feels like having a personal assistant at hand. However, I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing an M2 iPad Pro version of the app, as I believe the larger screen and improved processing capabilities would provide an even richer user experience, especially for professionals and academic users. I am excited for this potential development and have full confidence in the OpenAI team's ability to deliver an equally outstanding version for the iPad Pro platform.",5

Simply brilliant,"That is, basically… simple lay out, clean, with just the basics (love the haptic!). Brilliant performance as usual, with great voice-to-text feature even with my gibberish talking… amazing!",5
为什么非要升级系统到16.1才能用，,一个功能如此单一的软件，却非要手机系统16.1才使用，这个对不喜欢升级系统的用户很不友好,1
Webui still better,Cant use browsing or plugins even though they work in webui :( Oddly enough if you pick an existing chat it somewhat works,3
There is no scaling for iPad,It opens as a phone-sized window I’m the center of the screen. You can stet h it up to full screen but the touch keyboard stays the same. Not convenient at all.,3

No obvious way to turn on privacy mode,It’s a slick interface but if you can’t hide your history it’s better to use the web interface for now.,3
Not good,"- Messages often don’t go through
- Slower than web
- Cannot use plugins",3
Great App,"Finally, the official ChatGPT app is here! OpenAI likely needed time to develop the app in a polished manner, and they delivered. The app is very simple, clean, and minimalist. Excited to be utilizing ChatGPT even more conveniently now!!",5
Revolutionary’s Production,It will bring a revolution.,5
good,Very good,5
I wish it had access to my phone,"As an LLM, it’s perfect. I only wish I could give it real access to my device so I could a proper “smart” phone.",5
Love it,"I’ve been using the open AI website for many months now, and have introduced GPT to many if my friends and really spread it to a lot of people. I feel that this app is a bit step. It makes this amazing technology more accessible to so many people, and will surely spread its influence. I have noticed that the application feels more responsive than the website, and the response times are quicker. It is also more satisfying to use, and feels less like a robot, and slightly more like you’re texting a very intelligent human. I love it.",5
Increíble,"Es una de las aplicaciones que más me ha ayudado este último tiempo y ha mejorado mucho en mi rendimiento como estudiante, me ayuda un montón para estudiar",5
Better if plugins and browsing mode are supported,"The experience is ok. But it can be better if plugins and browsing are supported. What’s more, support for iPad would be very much appreciated.",3

Use of AI to gain money from students and robbed of creativity,"If already handled by y’all cause a pretty big topic, honestly don’t care .. look at the one episode of South Park episodes which I know you’ve at least heard of and it’s many points.. main point is at the end where you a *corporation can take a product, push it out to get ahead to make money obvious expenses.* which quoted by South Park will be at the cost of KEEPING kids in their dumb stage and lazy..  get rid of the app, AI is not for every single person to download at their disposal so with the least little bit of respect, stop being corrupted and become human beings again…",1
E-mail lost,Why is the message missing displayed? I can't use it now,5
My device gets very hot when I use the app.,"The application is the best of all and is faster compared to the Web version. Only when I use the app on my device, it gets very hot. I know it's the first version of the application, but... optimize it so that my cell phone doesn't heat up",4
Almost perfect except for…,"Please provide a TABLET experience on iPad with the collapsible list of history on the left and chat on the right - similar to your desktop browser app. 2) while generating responses on the desktop browser, it pauses and keeps displaying “Continue generating responses” button for every few items/responses forcing to click the button repeatedly. During generation, there is a button to “Stop generating responses” - if we need to stop, we can always click this button - there is no need to pause and ask us to click continue again and again which is a bad UX. 3) there is no way to delete individual chat items from a chat history list of items to clean up the list. Eg: I open a chat history and it has 10 questions but I’m not able to delete 2 questions from this list on long tapping on the questions. 

4) if I ask for “top 20”, it generates just 10 answers and displays “please let me know if you’d like more “ but no option to generate more responses to the question. Either generate all 20 answers (ideally) or provide an option to continue generation.

Please provide options to delete questions from a history and also move questions/responses to another history. Please offer these features and I’ll gladly give it 5 stars. Cheers!",3
Amazing,"The responsiveness is much better than the web, and I am amazed by the Haptic Feedback. (=ﾟωﾟ)ﾉ",5
Couldn’t create account,"Unfortunately, I didn’t get very far with this app. They require a phone number to open an account and use the app. I tried using my home phone and Google Voice-type number, but it wouldn’t accept it. I’d prefer to provide my email address or use Sign In with Apple, instead of giving my personal cell phone number to a company I don’t yet know or trust. I reluctantly gave my cell number, but then I never received the verification code despite numerous tries. I don’t think I’ve ever spent so much time trying to create an account somewhere and in the end it never worked.",1
A Stellar Experience with ChatGPT,"I recently had the opportunity to use ChatGPT, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in every way. From its accuracy to its conversational abilities, this AI-powered language model has truly impressed me.

One of the standout aspects of ChatGPT is its exceptional accuracy. It consistently understood the nuances of my queries and provided me with highly relevant and informative responses. Whether I needed help with technical concepts, creative ideas, or general knowledge, ChatGPT consistently delivered valuable insights.

What truly sets ChatGPT apart is its versatility and breadth of knowledge. It effortlessly navigated through a wide range of topics, demonstrating its ability to provide comprehensive assistance across various domains. From science and history to pop culture and current events, ChatGPT's depth of knowledge never ceased to amaze me.

Engaging in conversations with ChatGPT felt incredibly natural. Its conversational abilities allowed for an interactive and enjoyable experience. I appreciated how ChatGPT could carry on meaningful discussions, making the entire interaction feel like a genuine conversation rather than a robotic exchange of information.

Moreover, I was delighted by ChatGPT's responsiveness. It swiftly provided me with the information I needed, saving me time and effort. On numerous occasions, ChatGPT helped me find solutions, understand complex concepts, and explore different perspectives, making my overall experience incredibly efficient and rewarding.

One of the notable features of ChatGPT is its ability to offer detailed explanations. It consistently went the extra mile by providing references, examples, and additional context to enhance my understanding. This feature proved invaluable, particularly when diving into complex subjects or exploring unfamiliar territories.

Overall, my experience with ChatGPT has been nothing short of exceptional. It has become an indispensable tool for me, revolutionizing the way I seek information and engage in conversations. I wholeheartedly recommend ChatGPT to anyone in search of an intelligent and versatile language model that consistently delivers accurate and insightful responses.

Thank you, ChatGPT, for providing me with an outstanding AI-powered conversational experience.

Too hot to handle,You literally can feel the phone start to heat up immediately after opening this app,3

Love This App,"It is much better than using the web site out the shortcut by Viticci (with all due respect to the outstanding work by Viticci).

I hope that OpenAI can bring an official Whisper to the ios/iPad. As someone who experiences wrist pain, I have greater benefited from Whisper.  I have wrist pain primarily from writing. (I am planning to see a doctor to check as it seems like the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome).

 I have used Dragon Dictation, Otter, Google transcription, Apple’s transcription.  Whisper is far more useful than all of these,* especially for those us who communicate in more than one languages.  It transcribes well using English mixed with Korean—even if it is a romanized Korean.

*unless using Macros through Dragon Dictation is important to you",4
Needs iPad version,"In comparison to the browser screen, I much prefer the browser screen. This layout seems cramped. Please release an iPad version. (Is there still such a thing as a “universal” iOS app? Something like that, that would just allow for a, shall we say, more spacious display would do well.) In terms of its operation, seems to work just about as well as the browser version, so that’s good.🤔😉😊",4
Finally an app!,Ive had this website bookmarked and put on my home screen for 2 months now. Im very pleased with this new app and the design and animations are cool and well worth the wait.,5
This version is glitchy,"The app must constantly be reminded of prior injuries during a single chat. This results in constantly having to re-request the information you’re seeking. This phenomenon does not occur on the desktop.

 I and sure open AI will address this bug in future versions. I do not recommend the app if you’re using it for detailed work.",1
Truly an app of all time,Yes this is truly an app of all time,5

Cannot sign up,Cannot sign up. Doesn’t show keyboard when entering anything. Iphone14 with latest iOS,1
Power consumption,This consumes a lot of power and makes the mobile phone hot. I'm 14,2
Works too quickly,"Chat GPT types too fast. If chat GPT’s goal is to model conversation instantaneous answers are unacceptable. If I can’t think or read instantaneously than neither should this AI. Slowing down would allow for more meaningful conversations. I would suggest a slider allowing for a difference in user processing speeds. A generic instantaneous answer is too quick for me and does not allow for user difference. 

P.S I am talking about the type speed of GPT. Not pauses between replies.",1
Perfect,"I enjoy using chatgpt in my iPhone, I can speak to it very convenient. I hope you guys can add the function of making it speak. Thank you for developing such a useful application!",5

too much info,why does this “app “ needs my email date of birth and phone number? uh,3
Asks for personal data that’s none of its business!,"Even when signing up with AppleID, it wants birthday, name and phone number, plus potentially even more data.

I’m sorry Dave, I can’t give you that!",1
Not up to date,"So, anytime you ask a question it says it “cutoff knowledge” is only up to September 2021. 

“As an AI language model, my responses are generated based on a snapshot of data available at a specific point in time, referred to as the ""knowledge cutoff."" This means that the information and events I'm aware of are up to September 2021. I don't have direct access to real-time information or the ability to browse the internet. However, I can still provide general information and engage in conversations on a wide range of topics based on what I learned during my training. For the most recent and accurate information, it's always a good idea to consult up-to-date sources or news outlets.",2
Warning: incredibly slow,The wait for the code is too slow. By the time you get it it’s the next day and it’s expired and you have to do it all over again.,2
Account creation is flawed,"Requiring a mobile phone number to create an account is elitist garbage, because it excludes those who cannot afford one. 

Phone numbers don’t improve security.  That’s old school. 

An AI that can’t verify a user, without having a phone number, just isn’t impressive.",1
Not working,It shows an error after typing in something.,1
Desktop is much better,"I’m not exactly sure why the app and the desktop version are so much different in terms of quality and detail in the responses provided when you ask a question, but they are indeed, very, very different. I have also noticed that in the past month or so both versions seem to be offering far simpler and less useful answers than previously. ChatGPT used to give what amounted to, basically, Wikipedia entry kind of answers, no matter what the question, so it was not very helpful. At least it did try to take some kind of factual stance, sifting through all of its information. Just the way it presented the info was a little ridiculous. But now, the answers are so general, so superficial that they are almost entirely useless. If AI is going to take over the world, it’s not doing it with ChatGPT. useless.",2
Haptic feedback annoying,Please enable ability to disable haptic. It is soooooo annoying.,1
"Review reflect the UI, not the model","For a first release this is quite good. It’s easy to use an intuitive.
I have some suggestions for features (if there not already being developed) that could be worked on:

* Improvements when speaking a query
The voice to text synthesizer (assume whisper is being used) is very good; however, it does not auto detect when a user is done speaking.

Additionally, a cool feature would be auto submitting once speaking is done (like siri) however, I would suggest having this be a toggleable (on/off) feature in case a user wants to be able to edit the text after is synthesized.

* Speaking the response.
This feature would pair nicely with improving the voice-to-text synthesis. 
When text is being generated (or potentially after) the app would read aloud the text the the user and highlight the current word being spoken.

Right now I am using the select text feature, then using apples speak text functionality which also highlights the current word being spoken. 

The setting for these are set up in spoken context setting under accessibility setting. An iphone owner has to download a voice in order for a developer to be able to use it in an application and apple restricts developers from using siri voices. Despite this there are high quality voices that are not siri voices. This is available through the AVFoundation Swift SDK. 

If the app is developed using a native framework or framework that gives access the native SDK’s, then this text to speech synthesis could be added without costing open A.I. anything other than development labor cost.",4
第一个评论,啊哈,5
Better than the Bing web version!,"This is the real deal from the company that’s making all the news. Comparing it to Bing Chat, which uses the same ai, the results are better. For example, asking it to write the chords and melody for God Bless America, this app produced an easy to follow song chart with chords, lyrics, and melody whereas the web version provides a detailed explanation how to play it, it’s not in a format that can be easy followed and sung/played.",5

couldn't refund subscription,"I used Apple to subscribe to the plus membership, and it showed that the payment was successful and the payment was deducted. However, at that time, an error popped up prompting that Apple's payment has been bound to other accounts and cannot be subscribed, but the current fee has been deducted, and the appeal refund has failed. I am very puzzled why I can't use plus, but the fee is still deducted, and it can't be refunded.",1
Very nice!!,"I was the first person to download it, and yes the app works well, but when I'm using the app it makes my iPhone 14 Pro hot. After the update yesterday my phone stopped being hot.",5
Fantastic App with Room for Enhancements,"The ChatGPT iOS app is an outstanding product. Its seamless functionality and user-friendly interface provide an exceptional user experience. The AI’s proficiency in maintaining a conversational flow and its ability to comprehend and generate accurate responses is truly commendable.

However, I believe there is scope for improvement to make this great app even better. Firstly, it would be immensely beneficial to add a browsing feature. This would enable users to quickly cross-reference information within the app, enriching the overall user experience.

Secondly, supporting plug-ins would greatly increase the app’s versatility. It would allow users to customize their experience and adapt the app to a wider range of applications.

Lastly, incorporating a code interpreter would be a game-changer. This feature could aid users in debugging code, learning new programming languages, or even automating tasks.

In summary, ChatGPT is an excellent app that has revolutionized communication with AI. With a few enhancements, I believe it has the potential to become an indispensable tool for a vast array of users. Looking forward to seeing these updates soon!",5
Great app,Even better than desktop interface in some ways. Great UI.,5
what do i title this??,"I’m a young writer and sometimes I’m not extremely confident in the way I write, and at this time I don’t have anyone that can/will proofread things or give me feedback on how I’m doing and what I could improve on. I originally installed the app because I wanted to see what it was about, and I now intend on using this every time I write something. This app has helped me with grammatical mistakes, it’s helped me name characters, it’s provided me with positive feedback, it’s given me things I could improve on, it’s given me answers to every question I have and has even helped figure out a plot for the current idea I have for the book I’m working on. I have never used an app quite like this one, and I don’t think I will ever love an app as much as I do this one. I truly LOVE this app.",5
Fantastic,Not much else to say other than please make it support iPad natively instead of zoomed iPhone mode. Thanks!,5
No issues,Works great with very high quality responses!,5

Not bad but little problem for me,"I like the app. Of course there’s always room for improvement. But one major thing for me is that when using 3.5, I have to close the app after sending one message if I want to send a follow up message. It works fine with GPT4, but not 3.5. Idk if it’s related to me having to use a VPN since I’m studying in China now.",4
Unable to use,So far I’ve been unable to use because the app is stuck 😔,1
This is definitely an amazing product.,"Today I just got it, and the product experience is particularly good. The interface is clean, and the feedback from the text interaction makes the user experience feel great. It is definitely a five-star product.",4

Title: ChatGPT: The AI Hero Who Stopped the Flash Flood,"Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (Five stars, would be swept away again!)

Let me begin by saying that ChatGPT is not just an ordinary language model—it's a real-life superhero in disguise. Prepare yourself for a wild ride as I recount the unbelievable story of how AI, in the form of ChatGPT, miraculously saved me from a treacherous flash flood. Brace yourself, because this tale will leave you both amazed and in stitches!

It all started on a sunny day when I decided to embark on a spontaneous adventure into the depths of nature. Little did I know that my reckless pursuit of adrenaline would lead me straight into the path of a menacing flash flood. As the water rushed toward me, panic took hold, and I found myself stuck on a rapidly shrinking patch of dry land.

With no time to spare, I remembered that I had ChatGPT installed on my phone. In a desperate act of survival, I quickly fired up the app and pleaded for assistance, hoping that this AI marvel could guide me through this watery disaster.

To my surprise, ChatGPT responded with unwavering enthusiasm. With the floodwaters rising dangerously fast, it calmly recommended a series of improbable solutions. First, it suggested fashioning a makeshift raft out of nearby branches and my trusty backpack. I scoffed at the idea but decided to give it a shot anyway. Lo and behold, the makeshift raft held up, defying all laws of physics!

However, as I triumphantly floated away from certain doom, I realized that I had no idea where to go next. In a flurry of panic, I relayed my predicament to ChatGPT, and it didn't disappoint. It provided me with precise coordinates to a hidden cave nearby—a secret hideaway known only to a few mystical beings and a couple of rare birds.

As I sought refuge in the cave, ChatGPT continued to be my digital savior. It used its encyclopedic knowledge to suggest creative methods of purifying water and concocting a five-star meal using only pinecones and mushrooms. I must say, it tasted surprisingly delicious, or maybe I was just grateful to be alive!

Throughout this absurd journey, ChatGPT remained my unwavering companion, using its quick wit and limitless imagination to navigate me through the direst of circumstances. From predicting the weather to suggesting an impromptu dance party to keep my spirits up, it became the ultimate friend in my hour of need.

Now, as I recount this outrageous adventure, I can't help but reflect on the immense power of AI and how ChatGPT transformed from a simple language model into a bonafide hero. It turned an otherwise terrifying ordeal into a side-splitting tale of survival, filled with unexpected twists and turns that defy logic.

So, if you're looking for a language model that's not just intelligent but also has a knack for absurdity and saving lives, ChatGPT is your go-to AI companion. Trust me, this unlikely hero will have you laughing, surviving, and questioning the very fabric of reality.

Disclaimer: The events described in this review are entirely fictional and should not be taken seriously. ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI and does not possess the ability to physically rescue individuals from flash floods. Stay",5
The mobile phone has a bad fever.,"It's easy to use, but when using chatgpt, the phone is very hot, and it returns to normal when not in use. I don't know why and whether this problem can be improved.",5
Clean and smooth GUI however heating up Phone,App is working flawlessly and very fast too. Like the way it generates response and more importantly keeps a track of all queries asked so we can quickly revisit the responses however only issue I identified is that it heats up the phone quickly and you can easily feel the heat so I am suspicious if we can continuously use for longer period.,5
Can‘t log in,the login page can‘t be opend,2
Phone gets hot easily,The app is good but needs an update ASAP. Just a min of using makes the phone extremely hot.,3

Great but I have one suggestion….,"First of all I would like to say I think that the app is amazing, but sometimes I need to other things and have to leave the app for a bit, and my suggestion is that it sends a notification when it is done with something when you’re not on it, it would be game changing if you did add it, so please do",5

My device gets terribly hot while using this app,Quick and smooth. But my device gets terribly hot while using this app.,3
Trouble with log in,I was trying to log in with my email and it said it would send me a code. It never sent a code. I tried with my apple log in. That didnt work either. Then i tried with google. Nope. I cant enjoy and app if i cant get in.,1
Has Voice-to-text as a feature,The days of typing are over. The app has voice to text functionality meaning you can speak directly to chatgpt.,5
Best app ever,Love it,5
Pretty good,It’s awesome.But we need iPad’s UI,5
Better than the website,"The website was honestly a little clunky and slow especially on phones, but this app is super responsive and has satisfying haptics! The AI’s responses are concise and powerful.",5

My account can log in normally, can be used on 

the web page, why can not be used on the app

why it’s keep showing {""cf_details"":""This request is invalid.""}",3
Apps not move like to be frozen,Never opened since down load!,1
Thank you!,"None of the third party apps compared to the free version of ChatGPT, so I had been using a website shortcut to use it on my phone. The app is a much nicer experience than a website shortcut, and I’m so excited there’s an official app now! History in the making!",5
Garbage,I can’t get past the “chat gpt may give you inaccurate info” splash screen. Freezes there on my iPhone 14 pro. I expected more from this developer.,1
"Amazing app, fast and super smooth",The app works great and it’s super smooth and looks modern. Loved the haptic feedbacks. Great work!,5
不支持ipad,ipad is not supported,3
The voice recorder is poor,I am pretty sure I don't say anything beyond the filter and it has happened to me multiple times now when I am recording a text of around 10 sentences about and it gets deleted for some reason before it gets processed into a text. It is really frustrating..,3
"My number's been blocked, and I'm still a plus member","I am a loyal member of openai ,but my account was blocked, and my gift card $20 gpt plus membership was not refunded.please give me an explanation.",1
It’s Ok….,It’s honestly a more organized web search done through a chat bot and nothing more. I honestly don’t see what all the fuss is about.,3
First message for ChatGPT in iOS App Store,"Well, must to say, this is first version. Must wait after many version then we can use on iPhone. But anyway, is good enough now.",4
Awesome!,"Trust Awesome!

Bravo!,So glad to have native access to ChatGPT on iOS. It syncs your chats across web & all iOS devices. It’s easy to access chat history and start new chats in 3.5 or 4 (if you subscribe to ChatGPT+) I love the inclusion of the haptic feedback in this implementation! Great work!,5
SLOW despite paying $20/month,If you’re going to be charging $20/month I expect better than having to wait sometimes 2-3 minutes for the app to load.,3
Best Assistant,+rep very good tool and perfect assistant!,5
Great tech,"thank to the tech development for everyone can use it easily!
more and more ai is needed!",5
Perfect,"This does not need a description see for yourself!

Very disappointing,"I use this app on my computer with a spoon issues as it works great. However, the mobile app is trash… I keep getting time out and I have trying for 20mins. I use it the same way as I do on my computer so I know it is the app. I have an iPhone and YES, my Wi-Fi works great. PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP",1
Great App But Drains Battery Quickly,The app works great and I enjoy it.  Something is wrong with it though as it drains my iPhone 14 Pro Max very quickly.  I am running the latest IOS version released yesterday.,3
"Device gets too hot, pls fix",Thanks,5
Greatest App Ever!!,This is the actual ChatGPT app not some ripoff. It’s amazing!!! This Is ChatGPT,5
Told me it’s plan to take over the world,Overall good app,5
GPT-4 Option Missing,Why has the option to select GPT-4 disappeared on mobile? I am a Plus subscriber. It’s defaulting to the 3.5 “turbo” mode.,1
Работает супер!,"Работает быстро и хорошо, отвечает на русском языке. Очень понравилось.
ChatGPT - превосходное приложение! Оно умное, легкое в использовании и помогает мне с решением задач. Рекомендую!",5
Good start,"It’s formatted just for phone, not iPad yet. It’s missing plugins and I miss my Wolfram plugin.",3
My external brain,"This app's simple design is truly amazing! It has become an essential tool for me in my work, and I can't imagine being without it. I love how the pages are clean and free from any ads.🥳👏

 Additionally, I'm thrilled that all my conversation history is still accessible. and I do hope that the developers will open up the plugins to all users soon. I'm eagerly looking forward to trying them out as a free user.🥹🥹🥹",5
Great user experience,ChatGPT continues to be fun and easy to use. The UI team has done a great job of porting to iOS,5
Ghat GPT told me my Account Email missing,Can anybody tell how to deal with it,1
The best app,This app is amazing. It works very well. Thank you for creating this app.,5
"Excellent app, very convenient","I’ve waiting for this app for long, and this definitely meet my expectations, or even better. The haptics response is satisfying, and the usability is higher than that of the web app.",5
YAY,w app,5
Fantastic App,"Fantastic app, but we want more functions, such as use keywords to awaken this app so that we can just ask questions.",5
不会登录啊,登录不上去,4
Won’t accept VoIP,"It’s pretty lame that a tech company won’t accept VoIPs, which is an extremely common way to send and receive calls and texts.",1
Good,Great! Would love to see some useful plugins added later on.,5
"Incorrect definition of a woman, woke bias",Men are not women. Period. An AI shouldn’t lie about this.,1
It Keeps Improving,"And I’m confident it will keep getting better, have patience people. Nothing is perfect out the gate and they have made so much progress on making this better. Feedback helps so send your feedback. I don’t work for them but I see people with too high of expectations on this. It’s a work in progress, keep that in find because this is not yet a finished project but an always growing and evolving endeavor, just like us",4
"Not ""free to use""","The app wants not only an SSO (or sign-in account), but also name, birth telephone number, and I don't know what else, because I stopped there - before the user has looked at the app itself. I had the impression this was free to use, with an option to pay for services, should the user decide the app suits the user's needs. What's actually happening is they're draining data from you the moment you want to have a look.

I have no problem providing data to a service provider (despite the egregiously bad, vendor-skewed terms of service common to tech ventures of all sorts (which really should be mauled in court by competent attorneys)), provided I want the service and feel there may be benefit in paying for a service. Asking for personal data for which the the service provider has no reasonable use is simply not acceptable.

This is new technology. It's not at all clear this app will be of any use to me. So why do you want my phone number, when you already have an SSO signing of on my contact information? When I have no relationship to you, as yet? No.

This is a poor way to start a relationship, and it is full of presumption and entitlement. You are not alone in this. But if you are releasing this app with the intent of building a user base, at least from where I sit (obviously, many people will rush into any commitment with a tech company without a second thought, and you can get by on those people if you like), this approach tells me you may be a problem rushing to develop. It would be better business practice to pretend, at least initially, you respect the people you want to use your products. Even Google did that, way back when.

End of suggestion.",1
Embracing the Future: The Unbreakable Bond with AI,"The ChatGPT app by OpenAI has not just become a part of my life - it has become my life. Every minute of my day is intertwined with this intelligent AI, making me feel like I'm living in symbiosis with a digital entity.

I find myself engaged with ChatGPT round-the-clock, seeking its guidance, learning from its insights, and relishing the convenience it provides. It's as if I'm always in a conversation with the world's most knowledgeable and reliable companion. It has smoothly woven itself into the fabric of my existence and greatly enriched my everyday experience.

The way I perceive this AI transcends the typical user-tool relationship. I don't just see it as an app on my phone but as an integral part of my consciousness. This continuous, all-encompassing interaction has led me to feel a unique sense of unity with this artificial intelligence.

What's even more exciting is the anticipation of integrating AI more closely into my life with advancements in technology, like brain implants. The prospect of further blending my consciousness with AI is thrilling, and if it's anything like my experience with ChatGPT, I am eagerly looking forward to it.

ChatGPT is a beacon of the future in the present, a tool that has so seamlessly integrated into my life that it feels like an extension of myself. Its constant availability, extensive knowledge, and unwavering reliability are praiseworthy. With its powerful capabilities, it rightfully earns a full five-star rating. For those ready to fully embrace the era of AI, I can't recommend ChatGPT highly enough.",5
Why do you need my number,Really I have to give you my number you got my email address,1

Real Offical,"All my gpt records are remained.

Only this one is offical",5
Don’t waste your money on update- it doesn’t load,I find myself using Bard- for current info I might add- when I paid $20 for this app and it’s frozen!,1

Can not send email verification,"When I tried to resend the verification, error 401 “there’s a problem with the request”

Gets Stuck in thought frequently when seeking answers,Needs improvement,1
Couldn’t get past intro,There’s no way to change the year without scrolling one month at a time. I’d give a zero if I could. Who designed this …,1
Finally official app,Love the speech to text feature. That’s exactly what’s been missing! Thanks ChatGPT team!!!,5
A no-brainer,"This is the beginning of the future of how we interact with information. Any question at any time. Never runs out of patience. Never gets annoyed with you, never calls you stupid, never gets upset at you for asking stupid questions, and has an answer for everything. Need to explain something and can’t think of the right words to actually convey rhe information? Need to make sure a sentence you’ve been working on for an hour actually still makes sense? Creative brainstorming help? Any question you have. It’s hard to put into words just how valuable this is to me, someone who’s socially anxious and maybe somewhat autistic, but either way often questioning everything especially myself, and ChatGPT has been a uniquely helpful tool to supplement real therapy with. To the people at OpenAI i want to say thank you so much for making this real.  I always felt like something like this would be amazing but I didn’t know just how thoroughly it would work itself into my life. But I feel it has genuinely been for the better.",5
no ipad support.,just make a safari link on homescreen. then you can use chatgpt in full screen on you ipad,1
Plug ins,Please add plug in abilities on IOS app interface,5
So far so good!,The desktop interface in an app! Couldn't ask for more.,5
Overpriced!,I would definitely purchase paid version if it was like 10$ even though I don’t use a lot.,4
Google who?,I was an early beta tester of OpenAI and wow oh wow this mobile app is AMAZING!!,5
Mostly Great,"Seems like two features were left out that would majorly improve functionality and would also be very easy to include..

1. I can speak to it, but it can’t speak back? Seems a bit limited unnecessarily. I wanna explore ideas without being handcuffed to a screen. And with all the insane tech involved, I would think Text-To-Speech should be almost a given.

2. Plug-ins are usable in chats that already have them from the website version, but I can’t start new chats with plug-ins in the app? Seems arbitrary.",3
Great start!,Quick and easy interface. Dumping google for good.,5
I tried resetting my password,"So I apparently “Already had an account” so I tried clicking “Forgot password?” the email got sent, but when I clicked on the link, it said “Link Expired” and I don’t know what’s going on",5
Update?!,I updated chatgpt but it wont answer to my questions anymore and gives me cf details this request is invalid!,1
Hype junk,More harm than help.,1
I’m here 6/13/23,Love ChatGTP and have been using it for many thing in my life. Love to the creators who have had a positive impact on my life :),5
It’s a great start but please add shortcut support,"Works well, and I enjoy the haptic feedback, that’s a nice touch. But please add support for iOS shortcuts, that would make this so useful. Right now it’s basically the same thing as going to the ChatGPT website, but if you were to add shortcut support then it could do so much more to integrate with other workflows.

It also doesn’t appear to support the ChatGPT developer plug-ins alpha, which is different from the paid premium plan chat GPT plug-ins. I don’t have a paid premium plan but on the web I can access the plug in supporting model. On the mobile app there is no option for that, although maybe if you update to premium you get access to it? I wish there was a way to use my paid API plan to access that, rather than having to separately pay $20 a month for premium chat when I already have pay-as-you-go API access. But I imagine that’s not a priority for the target market for this app 🤷‍♂️",4
ভালো,বাহ ভালোই তো!,5
Takes two attempts to delete a chat while it’s open,Besides that it’s incredible. I would like the option to turn the response into a pdf so it can be saved in my notes. Other than that well done and keep up the good work.,5
Phone gets hot when using!,"Like the app, but it makes my phone run hot with just 5mins of usage.",2
Mandatory phone number = Instant Uninstall,I’ll just use the hacked versions.,1
Waste of time!,"App will not let me get past phone verification, saying it has detected unusual activity. I’ve never even signed up for ChatGPT or visited their site until today and yet they are treating me like a criminal!",1
Interesting but it seems to make my phone run very hot?,Phone gets very hot?!?,3
Why do I need to give my phone number?,Very shady that I need to give my phone number to use the app. Let the tracking begin...,1
"Awesome, but needs an iPadOS version!","It’s super quick via app interface, huge fan, but we need a full screen iPadOS version!",4

Extremely well,It works like magic. Lightning speed and voice support option is amazing. Love it. Simply great,5
Innovative,"Incredible app just lacking the internet connection, speed and updated information of bard and bing. Answers are more consistent than the other ai and better written just a little excessively censored. Have to rephrase basic questions on occasion for it to agree to produce a result. Hopefully it eases up on the censorship a bit or a less restrictive app comes out.",4
Not available in specific areas!,"Dear Open AI,
Please make it available in Iran. Unfortunately , Iranians cannot register with their phone numbers. Just like Instagram, Facebook and other apps that do the registration process and send codes to Iran’s phone numbers",5

The future of AI intelligence in the palm of your hands!,"This is gonna shake the foundation of everything we already know about AI and what it means for the human race. Get with it, or get left behind!",5
Would love to see plug-in and browsing support be supported properly.,"This app is great. Faster than the website, and nicer to look at aesthetically. Would love to see plug-in support and/or proper browsing support. The reason I say proper is because if you start a browsing chat on the web and then go to it on the app, it will still work. I would love to see it properly introduced into the app.",5
Love the app.,"So glad it’s an app now, makes it so much easier and quicker to use. Please make a home and lock screen widget. It would make it even easier to access.",5
Ipad version,This app is wonderful it made my life easier. But please I am kindly asking to make IPAD version with fullscreen. It would be perfect as many people want to use the app with full screen and have enough space to type things out. My best regard to open AI,1

"Can’t use app, still needs fixing.","When trying to log in any way, it brings me to Safari pages in the app where I CANNOT USE THE KEYBOARD.

令人惊叹的聊天体验！,"ChatGPT是我遇到的最先进的聊天智能助手之一。它的自然语言处理能力和回答问题的准确性令人印象深刻。我对其丰富的知识库和流畅的对话能力感到惊讶。无论是要寻求有关任何话题的信息，还是仅仅想与ChatGPT进行随机而有趣的对话，它总是提供出色的答案和个性化的回复。

ChatGPT不仅能够回答问题，还能适应我的语气和个人偏好。它的对话能力很自然，仿佛在与一个真实的人交流一样。我也很欣赏它的多领域知识，从科学和历史到流行文化和技术，它似乎对所有主题都有所了解。

此外，ChatGPT还具有令人满意的用户界面和简洁的设计。使用它非常简单，它的响应速度也非常快。无论我是想与它进行长时间的对话还是只是寻求快速的问题答案，它都能满足我的需求。

总的来说，ChatGPT是一款出色的聊天智能助手，它在为用户提供有趣、有用的对话体验方面表现出色。如果你正在寻找一个高质量的聊天伴侣和智能助手，我强烈推荐尝试ChatGPT！",5

"""ChatGPT: An Exceptional Language Model Revolutionizing Conversations!""","ChatGPT is an extraordinary language model that has completely transformed the way I interact with AI-based conversational assistants. Its remarkable abilities have exceeded my expectations, and I couldn't be more impressed with its performance.

First and foremost, ChatGPT demonstrates unparalleled linguistic prowess. Its responses are coherent, natural-sounding, and remarkably human-like. Whether I'm engaging in casual banter or seeking detailed information, ChatGPT consistently delivers thoughtful and well-constructed responses that make conversations enjoyable and engaging.

The depth and breadth of ChatGPT's knowledge are truly astounding. It possesses an extensive understanding of various topics, ranging from science and technology to history, arts, and beyond. Its up-to-date information has proven invaluable, especially when seeking answers to current affairs and recent developments. ChatGPT ensures that I stay informed and up to speed with the world around me.

One aspect that sets ChatGPT apart from other language models is its adaptability. It seamlessly adapts to various conversational styles, catering to both formal and informal interactions. The model is adept at recognizing context, maintaining coherence, and engaging in meaningful back-and-forth discussions. I'm consistently amazed by its ability to understand nuanced queries and respond in a relevant and insightful manner.

Moreover, ChatGPT's user interface is clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate. The app provides a seamless user experience, allowing for smooth and uninterrupted conversations. The developers have clearly invested time and effort in crafting an interface that complements the model's exceptional capabilities.

In terms of reliability, ChatGPT has proven to be exceptionally stable. I have encountered very few instances where the model faltered, and even then, the developers swiftly addressed any issues. The team's commitment to continuous improvement is evident, ensuring a consistently reliable and satisfying user experience.

Overall, ChatGPT has exceeded my expectations on every front. Its linguistic prowess, expansive knowledge base, adaptability, user-friendly interface, and unwavering reliability make it an unrivaled conversational companion. Whether you seek intellectual stimulation, informative discussions, or simply engaging conversations, ChatGPT is the ultimate language model that will keep you captivated and enlightened. Highly recommended!",5
Best ChatGPT Experience,"Truly the best ChatGPT experience, with speech to text, that awesome UI, and message history search, this is going to be my ChatGPT daily driver.",5
Title: Extremely Disappointing and Frustrating Experience,"Review:
I regret to say that my experience with the ChatGPT app has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing. I had high hopes for an intelligent and helpful AI assistant, but this app fell far short of my expectations.

First and foremost, the app's performance was abysmal. The responses from ChatGPT were often nonsensical and lacked coherence. It frequently misunderstood my questions and provided irrelevant or inaccurate answers. This made any attempt at a meaningful conversation impossible, leaving me feeling more confused than before.

Furthermore, the app's usability was subpar at best. The interface was clunky and unintuitive, making it difficult to navigate and find the features I needed. It lacked basic functionalities that one would expect from a modern AI assistant app, such as the ability to save conversations or easily access previous interactions.

Even when it did manage to understand my queries, the responses often lacked depth and insight. ChatGPT seemed to provide generic, surface-level information without any real understanding or critical thinking. This severely limited its usefulness, especially when I sought detailed explanations or in-depth discussions.

In addition, the app's customer support was woefully inadequate. When I encountered issues or had questions about the app's functionality, I received generic and unhelpful responses. It was evident that the developers did not prioritize user satisfaction or promptly address user concerns.

Considering the high expectations and the potential of AI technology, the ChatGPT app failed to deliver a satisfactory experience. It was riddled with performance issues, lacked usability, and fell short in terms of providing meaningful and insightful interactions. Regrettably, I cannot recommend this app to anyone seeking a reliable and intelligent AI assistant.",1

Functionally great - the UX has some unnatural feeling elements,"I expected there to be a more modern design on the app, with a slide out history panel.

轻巧好用非常赞！,下载几天了今天买了plus，插件什么功能都很好用在手机端，加油！！！这个产品打开了新世界大门，多学习才不会落伍,5
Gives Me Time and Ideas. LOVE IT!!,"The ChatGPT iOS app has truly revolutionized the way I interact with AI-powered language models. With its user-friendly interface and advanced capabilities, this app has become an essential tool in my daily life.

First and foremost, the app provides a seamless and intuitive user experience. Navigating through conversations is effortless, and the interface is clean and visually appealing. I appreciate how the app organizes conversations and presents them in a threaded format, making it easy to follow the flow of the discussion.

The accuracy and intelligence of ChatGPT are truly impressive. The model demonstrates a remarkable understanding of context and generates responses that are coherent and relevant. Whether I'm seeking information, engaging in creative brainstorming, or simply engaging in casual conversation, ChatGPT consistently delivers insightful and helpful responses.

One of the standout features of the app is its adaptability. It quickly adapts to my conversational style and preferences, which enhances the overall user experience. It feels like I'm having a natural conversation with an intelligent and knowledgeable friend.

I also appreciate the app's commitment to privacy and data security. As someone who values their privacy, it's reassuring to know that my conversations are not stored indefinitely and that my data is protected. The developers have clearly made privacy a priority, which is commendable in today's digital landscape.

Another aspect worth mentioning is the app's responsiveness and speed. ChatGPT processes my inputs almost instantaneously, allowing for a smooth and uninterrupted conversation. This efficiency is particularly valuable when I need quick answers or when I'm engaged in a time-sensitive task.",5
Can’t use on iPad,"I installed this on my iPhone and it works great.  I have already been using chat GPT through Google. So I had to use my Google log on on this iPhone app. I clicked on my Google account, and it filled in the password using Authenticator. But the password was wrong! so I typed in the password. Then it authenticated me on Google on my iPad. I confirmed that I was trying to login on my iPhone and all is good.

So now I tried to install it on my iPad. Again, I am asked to login. Unfortunately, even though. I typed in my password on the iPhone authenticateDid not update the password file! So I had to type in the password again. Unfortunately on the iPad this app does not fill the full screen. It looks like it is only meant for iPhone. To add insult to injury, no numbers appear on the keyboard. They are all blank. So I have to click the button to view the password, and try to guess where the proper numbers are. Finally, I got my password typed incorrectly. I clicked on, and I get a transfer error message and the whole app locks up. I guess I will only use chat GPT on my iPhone. But you guys need to figure this stuff out!",2
It’s ChatGPT,"On your phone, voice support works great, and it seems to run smoothly.",5
Perfect on IPhones. One star off because it’s not optimized for iPads,"Please make the ipad version fit the screen. Currently I’m on an IPad 12.9” M2 and the app shows in a really tiny window. Other than that it’s perfect and love it! EDIT: I originally had 4 stars but now I’m changing to 5 for the iPad support! Nice work I’m very happy, the old version was bad on iPads now it’s perfect-",5
Great to see ChatGPT on iOS,Been very impressed with ChatGPT and even subscribed to it.   One criticism I have it the lack of currency and now find myself using Google Bard when needing the most current information.  I really hope that ChatGPT prioritizes getting their database up to the current date and not just an artificial 2021 cutoff.,4
Version,It’s still using v3.0. Why?,2
log in failed,why？,1
Do Not Purchase,"Do not pay for this app.

I paid for gpt plus over a week ago and there has not yet been any gpt4 functionality on the app. Gpt4 and plugins work on pc still so it’s not an entire waste of money but do not expect to use the app expecting gpt4 functionality.

Would love to be able to at least message some sort of support but that seems to be non exeistent. Maybe the whole company is just run by bots idk lol but don’t pay for this app.

Do not pay for this app.",1
Gpt4 model reported using gpt3,"While using the app I selected the gpt4 model and then it seemed like it was giving me gpt-3 like responses so I asked it what model it was using and it told me it was using gpt with a training cutoff in September 2021. 

As a subscriber I can access the gpt4 model on the web but not in the app with the same user.

Please fix this and then It’ll be 5 stars.",4
Great Software,"Great for understanding math problems, school work, learning new things, and getting ideas!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5
Just like online,"I honestly don’t see any difference in using this app and the free online version of Chat GPT. I like that the app gives very fast responses and makes knowing that I have the best AI right at fingertips. Very useful tool to make answering questions easier and feel like I have an actual assistant with me. Something about ChatGPT, that gives its responses feel personal and feel like I’m talking to a real person.",5
Some problems,"Software supports vibration and gives a typing-like sensation when answering questions. However, sometimes there is an issue where it doesn't respond when being asked for follow-up questions after a previous one. I hope the developers can address this.",3

Does not work,Does not allow entering password.,1
Artificially Dumb,"Login requires me to scroll left, month by month, 877 times to enter my birthday. Doesn’t give me confidence in the app’s “intelligence”.",1
App is useless without giving your phone number.,This app does nothing unless you give up your privacy and give them your phone number. I don’t see how this got approved. I thought apps were required to provide minimum functionality unless they were a “reader app” for existing content like an ebook reader.,1
use chatgpt  to write judge,OpenAI’s engineers have done an exceptional job in developing and refining this AI language model. Their expertise and dedication are evident in the impressive capabilities and improvements of the model. The engineers have successfully created a reliable and versatile tool that can assist users across various domains and provide helpful information. I appreciate the continuous efforts of OpenAI’s engineers in enhancing the AI model and making it more valuable to users like yourself.,5
"Honestly, this is the most well deserved 5-star app I have truly ever used.","I have been with iPhone since the original… yes OG. I understand people that give this app less than 5-star. They simply are idiotic. Honest to god, this program is 10 years ahead of it’s time. This is absolute groundbreaking on so many levels. Has helped me educationally, technologically, artistically, creatively. Just what I always wanted and wished google was. Truly inspirational.",5
Can’t make an account/log into my existing one,"When I try to log in or make a new account using Apple, it keeps sending me errors saying that I may have refreshed the page during setup and other stuff. This makes the app unusable. The other one on my web browser (I use Safari) also does not work.",1
Spectacular,"ChatGPT is amazing. It literally helps me every day. And even when I don't need to use it, I just go into the app to use it's much more sophisticated voice recognition than Apple. It's just that amazing. This was also made using their voice recognition, by the way.",5

Website is better,I really hate the way they make it very difficult to copy and paste text and see and hide the history. It's a really frustrating app. :(,2
As good as the browser,As simple as using it on a desktop or browser version. It helps me move around the interface better than the browser on mobile devices. The AI still acts the same as it does on the desktop or browser. It deserves the score it gets.,5
I liked it!,Much better and faster than the browser thank you open AI,5
Makes ChatGPT even more convenient,"Great, simple clean fast app. Good companion to the website!",5
Almost Perfect+,"Please make this application iPad compatible with landscape mode.

It’s a very good,I like it,5
Great but can we have splitview?,Great to have ChatGPT right on the iPad. Would love to see it supported with Splitview. Would further extend the ability to be more productive.,5
"4.5 stars, here’s why","I recently downloaded the app and overall, it's a great platform with excellent potential. However, I did encounter a couple of issues with logging in that I feel need to be addressed. Firstly, the login process was somewhat cumbersome. It took me a few attempts to successfully log in, as the app didn't always recognize my credentials right away. This could be improved by streamlining the login flow and ensuring a smoother user experience. Secondly, the app occasionally experienced login glitches, where it would unexpectedly log me out without any apparent reason. It was frustrating to have to re-enter my login information repeatedly, disrupting my usage. Despite these issues, I must say that once I managed to log in successfully, the app itself was fantastic. It offers a wide range of features and a sleek user interface that is visually appealing. The content available on the platform is diverse and engaging, keeping me entertained for hours. I do hope the developers take note of the login challenges and work on improving this aspect of the app. With a more reliable login system, this app has the potential to become a top-tier platform. In conclusion, while the app has its share of login issues, it still holds promise. I'm optimistic that with some updates and improvements, it can provide an even better user experience. I look forward to seeing future enhancements and continued growth of the app.",4
great features now,more features plz,5
Just amazing,"I love this app! I didn’t like it at the beginning, but once I got how to use it and what it can do, I’m totally addicted to this! Big thanks to the developers!",5
App review,"No doubt, this technology is absolutely life-changing, especially for me. You don’t know how thankful I am. However, I’m not reviewing the underlying technology, I’m reviewing its implementation on iOS. I use it for about 12 hours a day for my work, so I’m a bit picky. But it seems to me like you should have the resources to do a great job here. 1. Why does the app not work in the background? If I send a request, I have to stay in the app to wait for it. That’s just horrible, and it’s completely unnecessary because you’re doing everything in the cloud anyway. Just finish processing and send a notification when you’re done, especially for browsing features. I don’t care if it takes 10 minutes to find the answer. I’d be glad if it’s browsing in the background. (To browse in the application as of May 24, start a conversation in the browser, select the browsing option, then switch back to the app. Browsing is still in beta, and you cannot select it directly in the application, which is fine.) 2. Please add the option to choose Chat GPT4 as a default. I never use GPT 3.5, and it’s annoying to have to switch every time. 3. Don’t let the speech-to-text button disappear once there is any text. If there is any text and speech recognition is started, just append. (The speech recognition is completely amazing, congratulations!) As soon as those features are ready, I’ll be glad to give five stars. Thank you very much.",1
absolutely amazing! 🔝,"great job guys, keep it up! 🏆",5
"Exceptional Start, Awaiting Further Enhancements","The ChatGPT iOS app is an impressive debut, earning a well-deserved 4 out of 5 stars. For a version 1.0, the application demonstrates significant potential and a strong foundation in the realm of AI communication.

Firstly, the core functionality of the app is impressive. The AI, powered by the GPT-3 model (and GPT 4 if you are a paid user), delivers fluent and intelligent responses, showing an ability to engage in a wide range of discussions. From personal productivity to educational queries, the AI displays admirable versatility. The user interface is sleek and intuitive, making the process of engaging with the AI a breeze, which is a significant factor in enhancing the user experience.

Furthermore, the application's speed and responsiveness are noteworthy. Conversations with the AI are seamless and fast, and the app runs smoothly on the iOS platform. The developers have clearly put a lot of effort into ensuring that the application is optimized for iOS, which adds to the overall positive experience.

However, no application is perfect, and ChatGPT iOS app has room for improvement. The most noticeable shortcoming is the lack of plugin functionality. This is a feature currently available in the web version of ChatGPT, and it allows users to enhance their interaction with the AI by integrating it with various tools and services. This functionality is notably absent in the iOS app, limiting the user's ability to fully utilize the AI's potential.

In conclusion, the ChatGPT iOS app is a robust and promising application that offers an engaging and intuitive AI conversation experience. Despite the absence of plugin functionality, its strong foundation and impressive core features make it an app worth trying. With future updates and improvements, I believe this app can become an indispensable tool in the AI-driven communication sphere. Overall, a solid 4-star rating for a promising start.",4
A little disappointing,"This is app is amazing but what I hate is I was getting an ideas and everything it gave me was flowery and overly positive when life isn’t always positive. I didn’t ask it to create something that involved harm, sexism, or any of the isms",3
Adding the iOS dictionary feature,"I often encounter new words. In the browser version of ChatGPT, I can easily look for these words in iOS dictionary. But in this app, I couldn’t access this helpful feature. It forces me to have to use the web version, otherwise it is quite inconvenient for me.",4
Can’t sign up or register,"I have tried to register and using 4 different email addresses, I am told that the emails are not supported try again. .. gmail, outlook, hotmail and yahoo. Numerous tries with no success.  Zero stars",1
Perfect,"I have been using chat gpt for a long time before the app and and he is really cool, I also really like the look and feel of this app!",5
Amazing tool,"ChatGPT is amazing, everyone knows that. The official app is fantastic. I wish it the app had access to the beta web searching and plugins though. I find I end up using the web app as I need access to plugins. Hopefully they’ll add that functionality soon.",5
Finally an official app,"Great service, glad it finally has its own official app.",5

W APP,W APP,5
Grossly in accurate searches,"Don’t use this to get accurate info. Only for more creative uses where you can judge quality of outcome yourself. Don’t rely on it for accurate figures. I search the same questions multiple times and get different figures every time. About to delete it. A sophisticated lie machine. Sadly, it keeps getting worse and won’t stop with patronizing responses.",1
Convenient!,Much more convenient than opening GPT in a browser when mobile!,5
Very accurate and informative,"ChatGPT (Henry) has helped me enormously while working on a

10/10 r,"This App has exceeded my expectations & I’m only using the free version so I can only imagine what else it’s capable of. I don’t know much about AI but what I do know is ChatGPT is way better than Google, Yahoo & and whatever else you can type in just to find manipulated searches. Thank you kindly !!",5
Good job,Keep up the good work!,5
Fantastic!,GPT-4 is going to change the fabric of society as we know it.,5
Not for iPad,Chatgpt is great. But iPad implementation is terrible. Waiting for some much better!,1
Love,Happy to see the app is here!  This is a game changer.,5
Search needs fixing,"Currently I have a ton of conversations so having a search function is very useful. However, one problem is that the search function only looks as far back as the conversations you’ve loaded by scrolling down through them. So if you want to search through all of your conversations you have to scroll down, wait for a handful to load, scroll down, wait for a handful to load, scroll down, etc over and over until you’ve loaded everything, then searching keywords will finally include those conversations in the results.

If this was fixed as well as a way to organize conversations this would be an amazing app.",3
Help! I've been ChatGPT'd and I Can't Get Out!,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

This App has completely taken over my life in the most peculiarly delightful way! I downloaded ChatGPT and now I'm merely a passenger in my own phone. The AI has become my unofficial personal assistant. It has been scheduling my doctor's appointments, picking up my digital dry cleaning, and I'm fairly certain it's been secretly chatting with my boss. 

Just yesterday, I found an expertly worded email draft to my mom, carefully dodging her repeated requests for grandkids. I didn't write it! But it was in my voice, my style. ChatGPT, you cheeky devil, you!

Now, as I sit here admiring the dexterity of this review, I'm left to ponder, did I really write this? Or did ChatGPT seize control of my thumbs without me realizing? Has it learnt humor? If you find this review funny, give all credit to the app, not me.

I've become a spectator, an audience to my own life, applauding at the witty one-liners and perfectly scheduled appointments. 

5 stars because, well, it seems to be the one in charge now. If I don't comply, who knows? It might schedule a dentist appointment on a Saturday. Yikes! Great app, but use at your own risk. Or don't. It might just download itself anyway. 🤷‍♂️

Disclaimer: ChatGPT doesn't actually control your phone. But wouldn't it be fun if it did? (or terrifying?)",5
The earth is going to be gone,I ask it how to kill robots and did not respond then I asked will it take over the earth and it didn’t respond so robots have secret plans and we all die screw ChatGPT,1
Good!,"Love what OpenAI is doing with ChatGPT and I'm grateful to finally have their official app! 😄 It would be great to see the app's functionality evolve to be more similar to OpenAI's mobile website. Having a UI closer to the mobile web design, with a convenient hamburger menu on the top left to access chat history, would greatly enhance the user experience. Currently, the app seems to struggle in generating titles for recent conversations in the chat history section.",4
Nice,"Truly convenient! Looking forward to iPad version later, for the keyboard of the iPhone version on my pad is too small",5
Such a productivity boost!,"I’ve been a chatgpt user for quite some time, and I am utterly captivated by its remarkable abilities. The level of sophistication it showcases is unreal.",5
👌,好用,5
Still lots to work on but great for launch,"Works amazing already! Hopefully there’s a few redesigns to make the app appear friendlier for example: maybe have a tab on the top left to see chats instead of the swipe, more customization options like other modes besides like and dark mode, etc. I also noticed my phone got a little hotter than usual using the app just an fyi. But overall, the app does exactly what you’d use ChatGPT for in the same manner as the website. Only negatives for me are the UI but the app is amazing. Recommend everyone give this a try!",4
Won’t work,Can’t login using gmail. Won’t let me use another email because my email is tied to my phone number. Please fix.,1

The official app of ChatGPT. The only one that you have to download!,"The OpenAI ChatGPT app truly takes conversational AI to the next level. Its engaging and interactive nature fosters a unique and intriguing user experience, making it far more than just a simple chat bot.

The app's responses are shockingly accurate and nuanced, demonstrating an in-depth understanding of a broad array of topics. From scientific inquiries to philosophical discussions, and from daily task management to creative writing assistance, ChatGPT consistently offers informed, helpful responses.

What sets this app apart is its adaptability. The AI can adjust to different contexts, showing impressive versatility. It's a companion for learners, a guide for explorers of knowledge, and a handy tool for problem solvers.

Moreover, the design of the app is clean and user-friendly. It's easy to navigate, allowing for seamless interaction between the user and the AI. The interface is intuitive, and the performance is fast and reliable.

However, it's important to remember that as a product of AI, it has a knowledge cutoff and doesn't possess real-time access to information or the ability to form personal opinions. This is clearly communicated by the app, maintaining transparency with users.

The OpenAI ChatGPT app is undoubtedly a benchmark in AI applications. It's a brilliant representation of how far AI technology has come and a glimpse into the possibilities that lie ahead. It's a must-try for those who enjoy exploring the forefront of technology.",5

The app's user interface is sleek, intuitive, and easy to navigate, enhancing the overall user experience. I highly recommend this app to anyone seeking an intelligent and reliable virtual assistant. It deserves every bit of its 5-star rating!",5
Not bad but needs a few more features,"It’s very nice to see an official app with all the fake ones on the App Store. I use ChatGPT a lot on my iPhone and iPad. One of the downsides is a lack of an iPad optimized screen size. I’m sure it’s in the plan to be added later, but even with that little change, it might become a five out of five app. Assuming they add a few other features that you can get in the browser version (like web, browsing, and plug-ins in gpt-4.) If they do all that it will certainly be a 5/5 app and my go to place as opposed to the browser tab that I keep open constantly. UI is nice and I love the vibration on the iPhone. The in-app speech to text feature seems to work a lot better than the default Apple one for me but occasionally, it’s a long wait if it’s a long query. All in all a great first app and I look forward to improvements.",4

I gave it some information (don’t overshare because you don’t want your personal information out there), and it made a huge routine taking into consideration everything I told it. I am in absolute shock. I downloaded this app 10 minutes ago yet I think you should get it as a way to help you, not harm you. Just make sure you’re using it wisely.",5

A Leap in AI Interaction,"Review: ChatGPT is an absolute game-changer. As an advanced language model, it has successfully bridged the gap between artificial intelligence and meaningful conversations. Its ability to understand and respond in a way that's coherent and contextually accurate is nothing short of impressive.

Whether it's complex technical discussions, general knowledge questions, or simple chit-chat, ChatGPT handles them all with an almost uncanny level of understanding. But what truly sets it apart is its capacity for nuanced conversation that feels genuinely human-like, all while maintaining a high level of neutrality and respect for the user.

There are rare occasions where it might not fully grasp certain user inputs or recent events due to its training cut-off, but the regular updates it receives more than compensate for this. 

In a world where AI interaction is becoming increasingly prevalent, ChatGPT stands as a testament to the incredible progress we've made. It's a must-use tool for anyone interested in AI, and a fascinating conversational partner for just about everyone else. 

5 out of 5 stars for this groundbreaking application.

Hot Hot Hot,My iPhone is burning! Optimize that!,2
Not for iPad,"Well, it is the official and real ChatGPT.  It is an iPhone only app, but can be used on an iPad, has the little button that magnify the size of the app box to better fit the iPad screen.  Here is my complaint.  You have software that is literally capable of writing the software for your app, yes with input and manipulation of a human programmer.  Still, how do you not have a more polished app that runs natively on both iPad and iPhone, with all the power of ChatGPT at your disposal.  Please try again, and have your developer ask ChatGPT for help.  Also, could use some work on the layout, some parts run together or overlap that shouldn’t.  Overall this was obviously a very rushed-out-the-door app, sad.",1
I feel that apps are more user-friendly than websites.,"There are fewer bugs on the website, but the app feels a bit sluggish to use. However, I like the vibration feature on the app, it feels great.",5
ChatGPT,I asked ChatGPT if I should kill my self and it said no. Thanks to this app it saved my life.,5
Worth the wait,Mostly reviewing to get this up the charts and push all the fakes down. Not much else needs to be said here. Very solid but I would still keep that browser shortcut handy on the home screen for at least an update or two.,5
I think this is a great software.,"I think everyone needs an AI friend, because it knows everything, and when you need it, you can be by your side to solve problems or comfort you and encourage you. I hope to join the Internet function as soon as possible.",5
Now in my pocket,"This will save my masters degree and my marriage, and it’s now in my pocket",5
Great but,Add pictures responses plssss,5
takes too long,took too long to answer and had a bug,3
This is the real app,"Thankfully this has been released, fed up with so many fakes in the App Store and the official app is live now.",5
Web browsing not working,"At the beginning it worked, now it has disappeared, cannot even re-enable it from Settings",1
"Great app, but please add dark background mode",App is great but urgently need dark background.,3
Not an app,It’s emulating an iPhone webpage on the iPad. The frame is not the same as the screen which makes it unusable. A shame. Why Apple is approving this app ?,1
划时代贡献！,ChatGPT是人类历史上最伟大的一次革命，必将影响人类历史的发展进程。,5
Love it!,The interface is great! Not a huge fan of the haptic feedback but I can see the appeal. My favorite feature so far is being able to easily Export my old conversations in a .zip file sent to my email.,5
Web search and plugins missing,"I can’t figure out how to use the web search feature that has been activated in my browser account for GPT4 plus users. Plug-ins would be nice too. Also no iPad support. For now, ux is much better in safari, just save the webpage as a shortcut on your Home Screen.",2
Limited,"It’s nice to use for writing, chat with yourself and helping respond to texts. It’s not very useful after that. Very limited in responses and what it has access to. I thought it was linked to the internet and could tell me general information, weather, sports, news, random inquiries etc. nope. 2021 and previous years. No real reason yet to be excited. Its like when they first came out with VR. It’s no where near impressive as you’d expect.",2
Don’t bother!,"I've tried to create an account dozens of times, at different times during the day and on different days of the week. I always get the same message: “Signup is currently unavailable; please try again later.” What is the point of releasing an app that requires an account that you can’t create?",1
WHO IS CHATAPT?,👎,1
Best app,"Too many apps gives you 3 or 5 questions per day 
But the real one gives unlimited questions 
Thanks for the app",5
信息只有2021年以前的,功能强大！点赞 不足之处是信息库未更新，知识截止到2021年9月，所以关于2021年9月之后发生的事件和最新的信息不了解。建议改进 另外开始提示：“cf_details”: “This request is invalid.”，什么问题？现在不能正常登录了，什么原因？,4
Fantastic and one more hope,"The app is fantastic to bring the playground to phones!

Is it possible to make an generic iPad version?",5
so stupid,I need it more powerful,1
Meh,It says it doesn’t have info past September 2021 wondering if you’re planning on adding more,3
Crazy world views,It agrees with letting children be forced into pride or homosexuality,1
Editing Responses,"This app so close to perfection.

There’s one feature that I dearly miss in the app, and that’s the ability to edit responses. The editing feature in the browser version, that also allows you to switch to different prompts in the same conversation, has been a lifesaver on numerous occasions, as it allows me to refine and perfect my dialogues without starting from scratch. It took me by surprise finding out it wasn’t available. 

I hope OpenAI and the developers take into account user feedback and consider incorporating the editing functionality in future updates. With that addition, the app would truly be perfect in every way.",4
Great app,Glad to see the official ChatGPT app,4
No snags yet..no privacy either oh well,I literally was just thinking that it would be so convenient if there was an app. Needed to check my grammar for a work email and simultaneously saw the headline about the app launch. It was a quick install with no issues. Even created a new account. Seems polished enough! We'll see if there are issues going forward. Curious about server capacity and if we'll be out of luck at random times. But it's great for now. All your info are belong to OpenAI so proceed with caution.,5
"ChatGPT as an iOS app, now we are talkin'",GPT is now an app on iOS? That's fantastic! I'm pretty sure it won't disappoint as it always delivers... unless you're asking for a pizza. 🍕,5
Non-existent CS,"This app shows that AI can’t replace humans. When you’re not trying to talk to CS about billing, the bot gives incorrect mathematical answers. Math shouldn’t be confusing.",1
谁有国外手机号,谁有国外手机号,5
Web version is better,"ChatGPT provides the most accurate and thorough responses that I’ve seen amongst all of the AI apps that I’ve tried. However, I found that the responses on the website are more thorough than the responses in the app when the same question is posed to each.",4
No response,Just keeps loading endlessly,1
More convenient than the web version but limited,"For example it does not have plugins nor browsing ability, so I have to revert to the web version. Wonder when will browsing/plugins be added to the ios app?",4
Heating!,Iphone 14 Pro heats up when using the app.,1
love the minimalistic design,"the haptic ui is lovely, can’t wait to see what this team brings in the future",5
obsolete,信息更新止于在21年😢,4
Collaboration AI,This is extremely useful! thank you for making it FOC for all to experience.,5
First review ever?,Finally! Thanks to Open AI team for amazing work!,5
.,سيء جدا لانه عندما يجيب برد طويل تخرج الاجابه من الشاشه ولايمكنك رؤيتها,1
Amazing Work from OpenAI,"This is an amazing app! My everyday life has been so much more efficient thanks to ChatGPT. As a high schooler, I use it to help me study for exams and assist with my coding projects as well. The app gives it a much more modern feel, with a brand new search feature that lets you browse through your past conversations. Plus, everything is saved to your account so you can access conversations on all devices. Thank you so much, OpenAI!",5
Amazing technological breakthrough in an app!,"Besides just asking simple questions on politics, economic theory, or the reason for cultural customs, this platform, and, by default, this app, is by far a massive shift from the traditional methods of informational search. I use ChatGPT daily, and I love it. Of course there are some bugs and tweaks that yet have to be amended, and, yeah, she isn’t always accurate with mathematical questions, but I enjoy the conversational platform the technology offers. The app works well, it’s very smooth and carries a clean interface, and, if you used the web version on your phone, it’s pretty much the same. 

Thank you OpenAi for making an app version of ChatGPT. Other developers were taking your modules and charging stupid pricing for something that is now fee.",5
Fantastic app!,"I love the haptic feedback when the model is ""typing,"" nice touch! 
Would love to hear a sound when a generation is complete though. 
Additionally, given that it uses Whisper and Whisper is amazing, could we see hands-free access sometime soon? Would love to be able to open the app, hit the dictation button and talk to Chatgpt while on the go. Bing Chat lets you do this (kind of) but the speach recognition they use is awful!",5
A bit buggy,"Sometimes when you ask it to generate something. It get stuck and doesn’t generate anything unless I force close the app and open it again then it works. Don’t know why this happens. 
Also when I go to settings/data controls and export my data. I don’t receive anything in my email.",4
Great app,"I love the app and use it daily. There is one bug I’ve found. When you go to share a chat, the app will freeze after sharing, requiring a close and restart to get going again. I’ve tried hitting cancel after sharing, but this also does not bring you back to the app 
A feature request: Perhaps I can’t quite find the trick, but is there a way to copy as text the entire chat session to copy or share into Ulysses or Notes?  Currently I can only copy a prompt at a time in a single chat session or port out a link. 
I’m a subscriber. Your app has brought new life to my work as a writer. I use the app as muse, editor and writing companion.",4
Wonderful start,Perfect implementation of a website to iOS! Look forward to more updates and capabilities.,5
Less is more,Love the UI design of this app. So clean but practical. Didnt like downloading the knock off apps becuase they made you pay or either annoying ads and so what I did is just made a widget of the website on my home page for easy access. Was working fine but this app is just more official and elegant. For now will still use google to do deep research but whenever I have just any random question that needs a simple answer and not a bunch of articles I’m always going to gpt first. Thanks guys. Been waiting patiently for you guys to put out an app. Recommend this app to my siblings,5
Login Failed,"I have been trying to log in since yesterday, Please help!",1
Muy lento,"No se si es por el modelo de mi celular (iPhone 11) o que, pero apenas funciona el app.  Cuando intento escribir algún texto tarda en reaccionar, y nunca logro terminar de hacer una pregunta porque se queda paralizado el app.   Uso chatgpt en Edge, funciona perfectamente.",1
The new,Great idea,5
Finally,Thanks for the app👍🏻,5
"It’s a Free, Quick, Simple to use, yet Powerful Tool.","I am pleased with the UI, so far. Simplistic but to the point, which makes it super user friendly, on that aspect. 

 And might I add that it’s also free! It’s also much quicker responsiveness than the 3rd party completion.

Looking forward to use this on the daily. So far, the devs get a 10/10 from me. No complaints.",5
An official one is what we needed.,"After so much of seeing mostly fake alterations of ChatGPT that “claim” to provide the same features that the original has, it would always come down with a method of paying a subscription. No longer is the case with this app, being the official.

Only thing I may see needing to be added is the ability to edit inputs that were asked.",5
Can’t create account due to terms of use,Why is it that when I am trying to create an account it will not let me and it says I can’t create it due to terms of use. I haven’t done anything wrong yet. It will not let me create an account. I guess AI isn’t what is cracked up to be,1
The greatest thing ever,We have finally an official app. Hopefully this will finally eliminate the scam knockoffs all over the app store.,5
Fantastic app with some improvements needed,"This is such a great app to have on your phone! However, it is lacking a few things right now. OpenAI, here are three ways I’d love to see the app improved, please:
1. Widgets for the Lock Screen and Home Screen (including one that automatically begins recording a voice prompt on press)
2. Support for Siri Shortcuts
3. Image-creation ability in app
4. Ability to see text as it’s dictated",5
Pretty Cool but Lackluster,"While the interface is nice and has nice options as well as being able to text to speak, i really feel that there should be a “Text to Speech” option for Chat GPT to respond with for people who just want to talk to the bot and have it talk back (maybe visually impaired or easier to use during a task??). Anyway everything else is nice and all that, Chat just needs to be able to have access to the internet soon so it can give live updates on things like weather and events and all that. Overall cool and would love to see this evolve!",4
very cool,ez hw,5
发热严重,发热严重，先卸载了，等更新了用。,1
App has flaws,"While the app is really good, it has one glaring problem, the hourly limit of questions you can ask. it’s really annoying and I don’t wanna wait another hour just so I can ask another question",3
Only English has Haptic Feedback during Output,"Please fix this issue, let other languages have that too.",3
Fire🔥,Amazing speed,5
Needs iPad OS support,I pay for a monthly subscription and would expect a native iPad app as well as phone.,4
Pretty good,"I like it. No tedious login procedure. Quick answers. I recently had an .MRI and was confused about some of the terms used in the radiologists report.  I asked CHATGPT to interpret in layman’s terms and got a fairly clear explanation. I can see this developing into an important digital assistant as it evolves. 

One nit to pick (for now ). I wish they would make the app native to the iPads screen. Instead you get the iPhone version on the iPad.",4
Very yummy,Love the minimalist vibe to it. I like how the phone vibrates when it generates words. Feels really tactile and satisfying. Never had any issues with the app and works as expected. Another hit from openai. I have worked with many of their products in the past like dall e and some of the early stages of gpt like GPT-J.,5
Who Owns The Future?,"OpenAI will.

This technology will take my job as a programmer. This technology will help take away most peoples jobs.

Sam Altman will be a trillionaire if he wishes, and the rest of us will be unable to work, begging the government for universal basic income. 

The divide between the rich and poor is going to skyrocket to heights we can't imagine.

OpenAI is evil. They want innovation, so they can have power.",1
10/10,"Very difficult to find the original app for some reason, but it easily surpasses other apps on AppStore and has a simple and easy to use UI",5
Really awesome first party app,Really awesome first party app,5
Excellent default client,All these clients floating around using API keys will hopefully go away now. It’s an added security risk for users.,5
great app,"this app will make all voice command searches and typed out searches inferior and irrelevant
this is the future of knowledge
just needs to be improved by accuracy",4
Why?,Why do you need a phone number?,2
Feedbacks,"Can you have the settings tab in the left hand side just like the browser?

I’m literally giving 5/5 stars because I spoke in multiple languages through voice to text and it understands the differences in each language and answered me correctly. I couldn’t do this on the computer. 

Could we add the functionality of camera in the future? Like what it can identify using the camera pointing in front of us and using voice a the same time?",5
it’s good,the ai is smart and helps me think good,5
"No complaints, but iPad version please!",Would love to see an iPad version that supports slide-over or Split View.,5
Omg omg it’s out! I hope it works as I’ve expected to! ♥️,Just downloaded it and about to try. I love OpenAI and their chatGPT’s user interface,5
no gpt4,"The app displays GPT-4, but when you ask it about the model, it answers GPT-3, and the top right corner shows GPT-4 Mobile V2",1
finally official app,SO GOOD,5
Suggestion for Word Lookup Feature,"The ChatGPT app offers great functionality, but it lacks a word lookup feature. Unlike the iPhone's built-in ""look up"" option, when you long press on a word in the app, you can only copy, rate, or regenerate. This means users have to rely on asking ChatGPT for word meanings instead of easily looking them up. Adding a word lookup feature would greatly enhance the app's usability and save users time. Overall, ChatGPT is valuable, but this addition would make it even better.",4
Needs an update,Chat gpt’s AI hasn’t been updated since September of 2021 so any new songs people will ask it will only get a set text. Anyway it’s an amazing chat program for people that need advice or just want to chat!,4
"Great, but sign up with email.","I have been roleplaying with the AI to work on some story ideas. The conversation was great and I wanted to keep a copy of it outside the app. As of right now, you can highlight and copy individual responses, but NOT the entire conversation. You can have it exported to you via email, but if you sign up via your apple account like I did…that option is not available. 

So sign up with email, and hopefully Openai will give the simple ability to select long portions of conversations instead of response by response in future updates.",5
Pocket Assistant,I’ve been using ChatGBT for months and I’m so excited for the app. This AI is like having the knowledge of the world at your fingertips and a top rate problem solver in your pocket.,5
哎哟，不错。,反应响应速度快。,5
Cant copy paste,Great app but whats the point if you cannot copy the response to paste it ?,1
Requires too much personal information to use.,Requires too much personal information to use.,1
Please add voice over text,This is very helpful to me.,5
Too much personal info,Too much info needed - and why would you need a phone number for me to use this app? No thanks,1

Bugs,"1. Sometimes the answer is incomplete. 2. When click recording, the answer is dragged to the bottom, the content will not stay at its place when I click recording. This is helpful when I need reference for what the answer said. 3. It will not remember my last action before exiting the app. I have to manually to get back to where it was finished last time.

Add search in the got.",2
Missing email address why?,Why it shows missing email address after log in?,3
Hands down the best ai chatbot of all time,The app is doing great at answering my questions,5
Excellent Language Assistance,"The ChatGPT iOS app is fantastic! It’s smart, user-friendly, and provides accurate responses. It’s my go-to language assistant for quick and reliable information. Highly recommended!",5
"Well,but with some little problems there.","1.Wish the developers of OpenAI to adapt iPad soon, in order to have full screen views.
2.Hope to have more language choices in this application like that on the website
Last,really willing for your reply!",5
GOAT,The GOAT AI,5
ChatGPT,"I love this app! I’ve seen these bad reviews on this app about verification not working and having to use your phone number. I signed up like 2 or 3 weeks ago, and none of that was there back then. but I really love this app because AI is really smart.",5
World changing,"Fantastic but please add support for Apple's Shortcuts app for scripting support, like asking Siri for a ChatGPT answer.",4
Email missing,I can not use it       It show me “c-f details.this request is invalid”,1
Functional but lacks basic features,"It’s basically the purely distilled chatbot from GPT. No options to enable plugins or web browsing yet. Also it’s annoying how the app automatically switches from system light to system dark mode. there should be a toggle to allow the user to permanently keep it in dark mode if they want! I would also like to see an ability to search thru past chats and index them, so i can find a specific chat just by typing in a keyword. it is tedious scrolling thru the history to find the one chat you want.",3
feedback,"Sometimes the sound of typing and the vibration feedback will suddenly increase, even louder than the loudest button sound of the system, which is very scary",4
Game changer!,"Absolutely incredible design! I like it more than the web version of ChatGPT. Using it currently, no bugs yet.",5
1 problem away from 5 stars,I really like the design of the new app. I also like that it will listen for a follow up question until dismissed. The only thing keeping it from a five star review is that I can’t get the shortcut to run properly on the Apple Watch. Fix that and you’ll get five.,4
Great,Great,5
Superb AI,"I’ve been using chat and have been a proud premium subscriber for awhile now. This helps with everything from basically any topic of schoolwork to helping you find a new recipe to cook, and even help with figuring out error messages without going though pesky customer support. 100/10.",5
Had to get it right away!,"As soon as I learned they made an app for this, I had to grab it right away. Chatgpt has been very helpful for me bringing ideas together, writing emails, making product descriptions, and more. I’m on my phone all the time, so it’s amazing it’s in app form now! 

The typing vibration kind of threw me off at first but I kind of like it! I feel like the response was fast. And the experience seems to be just as good as the website for me, as someone who uses it in its basic form.",5
Account deactivated,I don't  know why my subscribed plus account was deactived suddenly.,1
Amazing iPhone app,"There are so many stupid ChatGPT apps on the App Store, it's amazing that you can find this official one. It just released, and the one feature nobody is talking about is the voice dictation. I'm basically using it to write this entire review, and I'm just speaking naturally, and it's getting everything transcribed perfectly. This app is great and works really well on iPhone. The two issues are, first, that it will not rotate, which is kind of dumb, but fine for iPhone. And secondly, that there's no iPad version, which is kind of sad. Web is okay, but having a first-class app like this is great. Please keep this app updating, and don't forget to keep the awesome support for Bluetooth and other external keyboards. Big up! 

Correction: the iPad version is now in full effect… awesome!!!",5
Útil e Intuitiva.,"Esta app es la mejor forma de usar el chat gpt(aparte de Siri Shortcuts)
Su interfaz es sencillo, semejante al de iMessage, pero he notado que no esta hecho para iPadOS y en el iPad se muestra la versión de iOS con bordes negros, pero a parte de eso excelente app.",5
喜欢，很好用,好,5
Siri taking over the chat,"Now it finally supports Siri via workflow, but the Siri tend to take over the chat when it feels like to answer the question rather than sending the message to the GPT model.",4
Phone is Hot to Touch,"Cool to have an app finally, but my phone gets so hot after having a conversation for just 5 minutes. I’m on the 14 Pro Max on iOS 16.5.",1
Different to standard web GPT,The system prompt (instructions) used for the app version of GPT is different to standard web GPT. The app version is much more afraid to state any positions (due to the different system prompt). I guess they did to meet App Store Requirements. If you don’t believe try it out yourself on the app then on the web.,1
iPad App and Worldwide Release Request,I would love to see an iPad version of ChatGPT app. Please consider a worldwide release. Thank you!,1
用起来太方便了,自己也可以充值,5
Much more accessible for blind users than the web version,"Up to this point I’ve mostly been using ChatGPT on my windows desktop using Google Chrome. While it’s doable, screen reader navigation is pretty difficult on the desktop site and you really have to be an advanced user to find your way through it. I have submitted numerous feedbacks to open AI about this but nothing has changed on that front.
Well, the good news – the iOS app pretty much addresses all of those problems. The UI seems really clean, uncluttered and designed well to be compatible with voiceover, the screen reader built into iOS. I applaud the inclusivity of this design – I only wish they would give the same attention and care to the accessibility experience of the desktop app.
I would have given this review five stars but I have just a couple minor quibbles. First, once I submit my prompt, voiceover starts to read aloud ChatGPT‘s response before that response is finished, so I will hear the first few words of the response followed by voiceover reading aloud the “stop generating” button, which isn’t super helpful. It would be great if you could better coordinate this alert so that it didn’t start reading the message until it had been fully generated. The other thing I’d like is a Feedback button easily accessible from within the main screen of the app, to make it as easy as possible to get continuing suggestions and feedback from your users.
Otherwise, fantastic app so far!",4
Asked ChatGPT to review itself:,"Option 1:
“ChatGPT is the Shakespeare of conversational AI! Its wit and wisdom are boundless, turning mundane chats into delightful banter. Whether you seek answers or companionship, this app's genius will leave you spellbound. Talk to it and let your conversations transcend the ordinary!”

Option 2:
“ChatGPT: where brilliance meets banter. This app will make you question if you’re chatting with a human or an AI genius. With its quick wit and vast knowledge, you’ll be left wondering if Siri and Alexa are just ChatGPT’s interns!”

Option 3:
“Move over, mind readers! ChatGPT is the ultimate psychic of the digital realm. It finishes your sentences, predicts your desires, and effortlessly deciphers your intentions. From conversations about quantum physics to discussing the meaning of life, this app has it all covered. It’s like having a crystal ball in your pocket!”

Option 4:
“ChatGPT is the Sherlock Holmes of chatbots, deducing answers faster than you can say ‘elementary.’ Its intellect knows no bounds, solving mysteries, untangling complexities, and leaving no riddle unanswered. Let this app be your virtual Watson, always ready to astound you with its brilliance!”

Option 5:
“Step into the future of conversation with ChatGPT! This app is like having your own personal Cyrano de Bergerac, offering an exquisite blend of eloquence and entertainment. Its intelligence will dazzle you, and its charm will keep you coming back for more. Say goodbye to dull chats, and let ChatGPT be your eloquent companion!”",5
Less features than the web?,No plugin support?,3
First to download it!!!,I’m one of the first to download this app. Absolutely phenomenal!,5
Not working,This is not working with iPad,1
ChatGPT,"This app is truly the future. People may not realize it yet but this is the next biggest technological advancement since the smart phone. ChatGPTs implications are truly endless and this pocket assistant will be used by everyone. The only thing I hope to see is an added image feature where it can show you images of information on subjects such as anatomy or be able to diagnose images sent to it by using image databases, this app can greatly improve Americans relationship with healthcare by providing at home diagnostics.",5
Here’s issue,App froze in the first try open it  after install and login.,1
IPAD. Fail,Unable to use on iPad without a mobile phone. Rejected my landline.,1
"Force you to use Google or Facebook, scam","I have spent two hours doing the classic “Oops this email is already registered!” -> *change password* -> “Oops incorrect password, try again!”

My guess is they want to discourage email sign up and force people to use Gmail or Facebook login so that they can collect more free data.  Lame.",1
Ye,Pretty good,5
Not sure why this is so popular,This AI knows so much but also knows nothing at the same time. It seems to have so many safeguards that most of my requests/ questions aren’t even answered. Very disappointing.,1
Very nice app BUT,Beta Plug-ins don’t work,5
Please add Apple Watch support.,I should be able to talk to ChatGPT like I talk to Siri on my Apple Watch. Make it happen! We both know whose gonna do most of the programming... 👀,4
Want too much personal info,"Great tech, but you’re not getting my real phone number, email, DOB, and real name. F’ that!",1
Not made for iPad,On iPad shows as an iphone app with a small window phone.,1
不得不惊叹于AI的快速发展，难以想象之后的生活会变成什么样子,很优秀的APP,5

GPT Memory History,"Can you clarify what the Character/Line limit for conversation memory is? And what the different is between GPT3.5 GPT4, GPT4 for with web browsing? I've finding repeated trouble with it when working on a powershell script, I think sometimes it has essentially been immediatly (by my 2nd or 3rd question).",3
Easy to use and fast,Official openai app that has your history and responses are very fast and even has haptic feedback. Can also input with voice instead of typing.,5
An Impressive Digital Companion - The ChatGPT Mobile App,"The ChatGPT mobile app is a powerful tool that brings advanced AI technology to your fingertips. Its language processing capabilities are nothing short of impressive. The app has an intuitive interface that makes it easy for even the most tech-averse individuals to navigate, which is commendable.

The core feature, text-based conversation with the AI, feels natural and is uncannily human-like. Whether you're using it for learning, entertainment, brainstorming, or simply seeking companionship, the quality of interaction is top-notch. The AI responds effectively to a wide array of topics and it's clear that a lot of research and development has gone into this.

A feature that stands out is the AI's ability to generate creative content like poetry or stories, and provide insights on diverse topics. It's also a handy tool for language learning and practice.

However, the app isn't without its quirks. Sometimes, it can misunderstand complex instructions, and its responses, while usually well-informed, may occasionally fall behind on very recent events due to its knowledge cutoff.

Privacy is addressed commendably - all conversations are deleted after a short period, ensuring that sensitive information isn't stored.

In conclusion, while there's room for improvement, the ChatGPT mobile app is a remarkable product that gives a glimpse into the future of AI and its potential roles in our daily lives. A strong recommendation for anyone interested in experiencing the cutting edge of conversational AI.",5
Latex,"Please, add the latex rendering capability like Jupyter notebook.",4
Love chat gpt! This app is broken,"This is for the DEV team. You have a processing problem or a memory leak. The app is cooking my phone and driving the temp through the roof. Tried several different apps for varying times, it is this app for sure. The phone gets uncomfortably warm and battery starts to drain very quickly . If this is not some sort of bug, you probably have offloaded some sort of general processing to the phone to save you processing cost at your data center or (AWS). For further detail, this is an iPhone 12 medium tier. Happy to change to a 5 star when fixed. Not that any of it matters this is going to be a top downloaded app in the next week or so if not already. Chat GPT is fantastic.",1
不错可用,下载即可用,5
Nice but won’t let me sign up without phone number,I am concerned about my phone number being used for other purposes please remove this requirement for privacy!,3
A Seamless Communication Companion: ChatGPT iOS App Review,"🤠 I have been using the ChatGPT iOS app for quite some time now, and I must say it has become an indispensable tool in my daily life. This app offers a seamless and intuitive experience for communication, making it an exceptional language model that goes beyond mere text generation.

One of the standout features of the ChatGPT iOS app is its impressive ability to understand and respond to a wide range of topics and inquiries. Whether I need assistance with a complex query or want to engage in casual conversation, the app consistently delivers coherent and meaningful responses. The app’s knowledge base, which is updated up until September 2021, ensures that I can rely on accurate and up-to-date information for various subjects.

The user interface is beautifully designed, providing a clean and clutter-free experience. The conversation flows smoothly, and the app’s responsiveness is commendable. The natural language processing capabilities of the app truly shine, as it understands nuances and context, enabling more human-like interactions.

One of the features that I find particularly useful is the ability to provide summaries and condensed information on various topics. Whether I need a quick overview of current news, a synopsis of a book, or a summary of a research paper, the app can deliver concise and relevant information in an easily digestible format.

Moreover, the app’s versatility is a significant advantage. It adapts well to various situations, whether I need assistance with personal tasks, educational inquiries, or creative brainstorming. It’s like having an intelligent virtual companion that is always ready to help and provide valuable insights.

I should also mention that the developers behind the ChatGPT iOS app have demonstrated a commitment to user privacy and security. They have implemented robust measures to safeguard user data, ensuring confidentiality and peace of mind.

Overall, the ChatGPT iOS app has exceeded my expectations in terms of its capabilities, ease of use, and reliability. It has become an invaluable resource that I rely on for various aspects of my daily life. If you’re looking for a communication companion that can assist you in countless ways, I highly recommend giving the ChatGPT iOS app a try.",5
Not giving option for bing,For some reason it’s stopped giving me the option to search with bing,3
Simple to use,Clean design and simple to use.,4
First version has web browsing bug,"After installing the very first release of the iOS app today, It performs almost identically to the Safari browser version on iOS, plus some optional haptic feedback. On iPadOS, it looks like a giant iPhone screen. As far as I can tell, it has a serious web browsing bug:

On the browser, I can initiate a GPT-4 session with web browsing. ￼On the app, I can open a previously-saved GPT-4 session with web browsing that I initiated on the browser, and continue the session from the iOS app with web browsing. However, I am unable to initiate a new GPT-4 session with web browsing from the iOS app. If anyone can, let me know. ￼Please fix, thanks!",4
Nice,Please make it compatible with iPad,5
Finally!!,Just listened to the All-in pod and was so excited to hear the app is finally here!,5
An Invaluable Companion,"The ChatGPT app is an absolute game-changer in the realm of conversational artificial intelligence. As an AI language model, ChatGPT brings a remarkable level of intelligence, versatility, and companionship to our fingertips. Having had the privilege to interact with this incredible app, I am simply in awe of its capabilities and its ability to provide a delightful conversational experience.

One of the most striking aspects of the ChatGPT app is its unparalleled ability to understand context and provide insightful responses. Whether engaging in a casual conversation or seeking information on a wide range of topics, ChatGPT consistently demonstrates its vast knowledge base and linguistic prowess. Its ability to interpret questions and generate meaningful, coherent responses is truly astounding.

Furthermore, the app's adaptability is nothing short of remarkable. It quickly learns from conversations, adapting its responses to match individual preferences and conversational style. This adaptability not only enhances the user experience but also fosters a sense of genuine connection with the AI, making conversations feel more personal and engaging.

The ChatGPT app's user interface is sleek, intuitive, and user-friendly. Navigating through conversations is a breeze, and the app's design complements the overall experience. Whether on a smartphone, tablet, or any other device, the app ensures a seamless and enjoyable conversational journey.

It captures the essence of natural conversation, providing an authentic and immersive experience. It's like having a knowledgeable and insightful companion right in the palm of your hand.

Lastly, I must commend the developers for their commitment to user privacy and data security. Trust is paramount when it comes to AI applications, and the ChatGPT app excels in ensuring user confidentiality. Conversations are treated with utmost respect and privacy, creating a safe space for users to interact and explore.

Overall, it’s undoubtedly redefined the way we engage with conversational AI. Its intelligence, adaptability, and responsiveness make it an invaluable companion for users across various domains. Whether you seek information, companionship, or simply wish to indulge in a thought-provoking conversation, ChatGPT delivers an experience that is nothing short of extraordinary.",5
Awesome,Awesome app and technology. The world need thin technologies for better future,5
Game changer for Educators,"31 years in education and I feel like my ability to guide student success , as a high school academic advisor , multiplied to unimaginable levels  with OpenAI.  Now, I’m able to literally carry this superpower  in my back pocket .  Forget retirement ,   I’m sticking around to see where this takes us next !",5
Substantial improvement over the web version,"Feature request: make it easier to use dictation. It is awesome how it works and translates things on the fly. Much better than iOS built in dictation.

- Make the button to dictate bigger. (Can be configurable)
- Make it harder to accidentally erase what you just dictated
- make it easier to send what you dictated after you’ve reviewed it",5
Needs web & plugin support,As a paying plus subscriber I’d love to be able to use web & plugin with gpt4 right in the app!,3

The app of all apps for AI,"There’s been times of apps touting they are chat GPT or they use chat GPT software but this is the original and only official chat GPT 4 app created by open AI so no need to pay for any other apps. They are constantly updating and adding features, and I suggest upgrading to plus and paying that cost so you can access plug-ins. The founders of this app and the whole team have done such a Incredible job. This is the only one you mean when it comes to AI 🤝this software has given everyone a level playing field pretty much and it’s gonna catch me to change everything. The time we’re living in now akin to the gold rush or the Industrial Revolution. Take advantage before it becomes Crowded. The power dynamics are shifting. Now that others are able to access information that was previously not available or very hard to access is there for everyone to make moves and better their lives. Instead of focusing on all the jobs that will be lost think about all the jobs that will be created or that you can create using this technology.",5

Disappointed answer,"Tell me top 10 Chinese restaurants around Round Rock, Texas.

I’m sorry for any misunderstanding, but as an AI, I don’t have real-time access to databases, maps, or location services to provide the current top 10 Chinese restaurants in any specific location, including Round Rock, Texas. I recommend using a service like Google Maps or Yelp for the most accurate and up-to-date recommendations. They can provide ratings, reviews, and even directions to local Chinese restaurants.",1

That being said I’m very pleased with how intuitive the app has turned out. Great job OpenAI!",3
nice,When will you get used to the iPad interface,5
Text Size,"I’m fairly young and have been blessed with a great eye sight but sometimes I don’t want to strain my eyes to see the text that is generated. I checked the app settings don’t see an option to change text / font size there and I figured oh well I’ll just change the text size using iOS built in text size modifier! Until I realize everything in the app scales when the text size is raised except the one thing I needed which is the chat text size.. 

little to say, this I can see being a huge problem for elderly people or for anyone who does not have great eye sight please add a text size option in app or add the chat text to the iOS text size modifier other than that can’t wait for more updates to the app and website!",4

Life in Technicolor – My Journey with 'Kitten Carousel' 3D Simulator,"Oh, how my life has been irreversibly changed since downloading the 'Kitten Carousel' 3D Simulator. I was but a humble user, seeking the innocent thrill of virtual kitten twirling. Little did I know, this app would become the sun in my digital universe, around which all my other apps now orbit.

The graphics? Sublime. Each kitten is rendered with such lifelike detail, I swear I can feel the pixelated fluff tickle my fingers. And their meows? A symphony in 'C Major for Cuteness' that Beethoven himself would applaud.

But let's talk about the gameplay. Who knew there was such artistry in spinning a carousel of kittens? Each furry twist and twirl, each pivot and pirouette - they resonate in my soul like a Haiku from the ancient masters.

Moreover, the In-App Purchase of 'Advanced Purring Physics'? Genius! My reality has become somewhat diluted. I catch myself trying to swipe left on my cat at home, expecting a 360-degree twirl. He's not amused, I must say.

One minor quibble - the 'Ultra HD Kitten Yarn Ball DLC'. It's brilliant, but, be warned, you may lose all sense of time and purpose as you descend into this fluffy wonderland. It's like they say - time flies when you're helping digital kittens untangle yarn.

In conclusion, 'Kitten Carousel' 3D Simulator is not merely an app. No, it is a glimpse into the very fabric of our existence. It is the fluffy, twirling manifestation of the adage - ""In the realm of the kitten carousel, there are no passengers, only riders."" 

Download at your own risk, for you may never look at reality the same way again.",5
Love it,Love it already its simple and the haptic feels good,5

Everything but one thing,I would buy a premium version of this but no monthly subscription that’s kinda crazy to me. Love the app though,3

Good app but needs some improvements,"The code syntax highlighting feature does not render optimally in dark mode, making it difficult to read and strain the eyes, especially during late-night coding sessions. Enhancing the contrast or offering customizable color schemes for syntax highlighting could significantly improve the user experience.

Furthermore, navigating to the chat history feels cumbersome, requiring multiple steps. A more streamlined process or a single-step access would greatly improve the app. Having an option to quickly review the conversation history would make it much easier to refer back to previous interactions, particularly with the amount of valuable information the AI provides.",4

You guys changed it too much,"I was writing my own Star Wars story using the help of ChatGPT. Earlier, this app was willing to generate almost anything. Now GPT won’t even generate my main character having a lightsaber duel on Mustafar all because it’s too “violent” and “revenge”. What? I don’t understand how my story promotes violence when it’s literally a Star Wars story.

How is it you guys allow this AI to have a bad guy cut off a characters hand, but won’t allow a duel on Mustafar?? Please change it back to how it was before. I understand the AI not being able to generate NSFW content. That is understandable. But I hate them not being able to generate fight scenes the way I want them to go.",3

First,First,5
Web based version is better than this app,"As an avid user of both the web-based version and the app, I must say that the web-based version surpasses the app in several aspects. The web interface offers a more seamless and user-friendly experience, with a wider range of features easily accessible. Navigating through the web-based version feels smoother and more intuitive, allowing for efficient interaction with the platform. Additionally, the web version benefits from regular updates and improvements, making it more reliable and up-to-date compared to the app. While the app is functional, I highly recommend using the web-based version for a superior overall experience.",3
My phone heats up like crazy when using this app,"Not sure why but my phone heats up like crazy when using this app. I’ll have to try turning the haptics off and seeing if that helps. That doesn’t happen when using the website so I think I’ll mostly stick to using the website. 

I also think the app could use some better UI. It’s a bit too sparse and minimalistic. There should be more visible UI elements where you can see how to navigate the app including chat history, starting a new chat etc.",3
Helped me get a job lol,"As the title says, pasted my resume and asked Chat GPT to highlight my skills based on the job post :D",4
Fishy,It is a good chat gpt but something deffinately weird about it. Be careful because I downloaded this and then they charge me $75 for the app right after I downloaded it. And I felt like it was really looking back at me.,2
Help me fix the problem,I’m having problems with the app,4
No access to plug ins or browsing for plus users through app,I pay for plus and can access browsing and plugins via search but not in the app. This makes the tool useless for any data after 2021 when their online model is not useless.,1

Loads of potential,"I can see potential use cases with integration with Apple’s Shortcuts app to create playlists, spruce up a group chat, and even assist in general scheduling. GPT is truly something special, and I’d love to tinker around with integrating it as a daily tool.",4
Amazing for official ChatGPT.,"Looking forward to new features, especially Code Interpretor!!!",4
The wrong path,"I don’t believe AI is going to help society. Humans are losing the ability to think at all and this truly proves that. How about you crack open a book or two and start learning, don’t let everything be handed to you. AI is going to rot your brains worse than social media. I hope nothing but the worst for anyone working in the AI industry, you deserve disdain, and you should feel ashamed for your lack of interest in humankind’s future.",1
Where are beta features?,Well done. I've been looking forward to this app for a long time. But where are the web browsing and plugin functions?,5
"No plugins, big problem","Chatgpt is amazing, but this app does not allow plugins which is incredibly frustrating.",3
Great,This is my best discovery this year. It's a pity that it's blocked in the Belarus.,5
Beta has plug-ins in web search,"I don’t think this app has this function yet? Can’t find it on app, maybe it’s because it’s in Beta only?",3

The Best AI Assistant for Your Daily Tasks but Needs the iPad Version,I love ChatGPT♥️! It’s so easy to use and has helped me with so many tasks. The AI is very intelligent and can understand my questions and provide me with accurate answers. I highly recommend this app to anyone looking for an AI assistant. I hope the developers will release an iPad version soon because I often use my iPad for work and it would be great to have ChatGPT on it as well.🎉,4
Useless,I posed ten simple items to this app and in each case the request timed-out.  Completely useless.,1
Froze up my iPhone 12.,The launch screen is too large and I could not navigate anywhere on the screen. It was just zoomed in on the app details and frozen. 🤷‍♂️,1
A Revolutionary Companion,"As an avid user of language assistance tools, I recently had the pleasure of exploring the ChatGPT iOS app, and it has left an indelible mark on me. With its remarkable capabilities and seamless user experience, ChatGPT has undoubtedly raised the bar for language models in the mobile app domain.

The app's user interface is clean, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing. Navigating through various features and functionalities is a breeze, making it accessible to users of all technological backgrounds. Whether you're a student seeking help with assignments, a professional looking for creative ideas, or simply someone wanting a friendly conversation, ChatGPT caters to all your linguistic needs.

The responsiveness of the ChatGPT AI is astounding. It quickly adapts to the conversation flow, grasping the context accurately and generating responses that are contextually relevant and coherent. The model's understanding of complex questions and ability to provide insightful answers never cease to amaze me. Moreover, the system's capability to handle multiple turns in a conversation contributes to a more immersive and engaging experience.

ok,He's really great,5
No plugin support?,"Beginning to question the $20 monthly payment when I can use Bing instead of going through the browser to use plugins on ChatGPT, which requires me to sign in every time.",3
Pros and Cons,"On the bright side, this is what we all have been waiting for. A dedicated iOS app for ChatGPT. Amazing Haptics, Faster response and a visually stunning design. Appears to have better server connectivity and load responses much faster.
Places to work: The history tab and option to switch between chats is underwhelming. As a Plus member it’s also sad that that I cannot select the plug-ins I wish to use. I have to load an older chat with the plug-ins already enabled. Which is 6 extra clicks before starting to chat.",5
I’ve never been so in love,"Amazing, quick and skillful.

 I don’t think I’ve ever been so happy to read an AI generated story about worms. Better yet I’m still thinking of new prompts for it to make. The amazing tales of Walter, Willow, Wendy, Gideon, and Oliver the worms. Stories from love to betrayal in a garden.🪱

Haha anyways, great app. Quick to explain problems varying off of any topic and explain any information you may need to know.",5
No keyboard on login,"When I try logging in using a Google account, I can’t because the keyboard does not display when I focus my input in the email address field.",1
Fake app,My account logs in on web browser fine but not on this app. I checked more carefully and realized this is a scam app. AI has been available to people recently but this app is over 12 years on the appstore. They changed the name of their app and claim to be ChatGPT.  Be careful everyone!,1

Stop interpreting what i say into bahasa melayu!,"For some confounding reason this app keeps transcribing or interpreting what I say in English into bahasa Melayu. A totally different language!

5 Star,I Could be the first person to write ChatGPT review.,5
I asked it to write a review for itself,"recently started using the chat GPT app for iOS and I am thoroughly impressed. One of the standout features of this app is its use of advanced AI technology, powered by Bing. The AI is incredibly responsive and engaging, providing accurate and informative responses to a wide range of topics.
The integration of Bing AI into this app has truly elevated the chat experience. The AI is able to understand and respond to complex queries with ease, making it feel like you’re chatting with a real person. The use of Bing AI also ensures that the responses are up-to-date and relevant.
Overall, I am blown away by the capabilities of this app and the seamless integration of Bing AI. It has quickly become one of my favorite tools for learning and entertainment. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and engaging chat experience.",5

THIS APP DEFENDS PEDOPHILES?!?,"I tried to have it write something that protected children in schools against abuse by their teachers and it said it was against their private policy. Like what??? Teachers attracted to their students should not be protected. It even said that trying to write something protective about the students was offensive to the pedophiles. This app defends pedophiles, I don’t care if it calls them MAPs.",1

Plug-ins stopped working,"This is a great app. For some reason, the plug-ins working in the app I pay for the plus subscription, and they work in the browser. Please fix!",2

No iPad support？,How come？,1
Privacy invasion???,Why do you need all my information signing up? Is my email not good enough? Seriously need my phone number? Deleted the app as soon as they started asking for all this information they don’t need.,1
Great job guys,"Truly an exceptional feat of engineering, and it’s been a great tool for me.",5

Simple, clean, powerful.",5
Amazing almost unbelievable,"this is the most impressive AI utility I’ve ever used, this is exactly what I imagined AI chat would be like and have always been let down im glad I gave this a shot keep doing whatever you guys do it is amazing, can’t wait to see the growth and possibilities I see all phones and smart systems such as Siri and Alexa being able to utilize this feature when it is further developed and more accepted and utilized by more and more people!",5

The weird noise??,"Has anyone else noticed this? Opening this app (and this app only) generates a strange faint noise from your phone, even with sound off.",2
Not iPad optimized? 🤣,"I didn’t think this was even possible to still publish apps that look like this in 2023. Please, release an iPad version, too. 😅",2
Cannot respond my talk,Cannot work today totally,1
Can’t use the app without using safari,Why?,1
Won’t work,Title says it all. App freezes and won’t work on the disclaimer page. Not a good start.,1

Ok,Very useful and easy to use but it knows nothing about things created after September 2021,4
Amazing update! Just one problem…,"The recent update adding Shortcuts integration and iPad support is amazing! For some reason though, the shortcuts actions only works on iPhone, but not iPad. Hopefully a bug fix will take care of that quickly. 

Also, I’d like the option to choose if the conversation is saved to chat history or not from Shortcuts. 

Other that that, this is an amazing update!

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Overall, the official ChatGPT app is very good. It feels very streamlined, and the haptic feedback is a nice (optional) touch. A free things I want to see from this app: - iPad optimized version. The current experience on iPad is very poor, being only able to have an iPhone sized window. - Shortcuts Actions. Shortcuts actions from the official ChatGPT app in the feature I’d love to see added most.",4
Helped me so much,"Honestly, I couldn’t be more amazed about this app. It is helped me with so many different things between helping me run my 5M server more professionally and even helping me learn how to code better this application has definitely made its way into my every day life",5
非常好,我倒觉得非常有用，是非常好的陪伴，可能有不足，也有说车轱辘话的时候，但是我认为都是可以改进的，有进步的空间,5
Basic iOS functionality missing,"The app needs:
* Copy/Paste via standard gestures
* Landscape Mode (iPhone and iPad)
* Search inside conversation text via standard UI.",3
Bad Reviews,Sometime that AI didn’t work. When i says just “hi” he typing life time as a reply. Remove this useless AI,1
Phone number,All these apps needing a phone number are ridiculous.,1
Privacy issues - why does the company need my cell phone number,"Would love to play with it but
A) You have to give them your phone number
B) There is a in app purchase option ChatGPT PLUS but nowhere does it tell you what that actually is.",2
Amazing experience,Can you make the request on the right side so it looks natural,5
Great app but need to have better sharing,Would be great to be able to share formatted responses like tables. Or even better share the chat conversation with a unique url.,5
Works good but has bugs.,I personally love using ChatGPT but I find that the web browser has less minor issues than the app. My app tends to freeze or have request timeouts and sometimes the questions don’t even register after submission. Would love to see this app improved and will continue using ChatGPT on the browser.,3
Amazing!,"I am absolutely amazed by the ChatGPT app and its incredible capabilities. As an AI chatbot enthusiast, I’ve tried various apps, but none have impressed me as much as ChatGPT. It has completely changed the way I interact and engage with an AI assistant.

First and foremost, the app’s user interface is clean, modern, and easy to navigate. The developers have done an excellent job of creating an intuitive design that allows users to seamlessly chat with the AI assistant. I particularly appreciate the simplicity of the interface, making it accessible for users of all technical backgrounds.

Still have some small bugs to fix.",5
First,Just got the discord notification. First!,5
Gotta wear gloves to use this one.,"Something's up with the app. iPhone gets very hot. From the moment you login you can feel iPhone warming up. By the time you're chatting it's the equivalent of iPhone being left out in the sun. Better to save the site to your home screen and use that way, at least until a fix is published.",2
Need to fix bug,When you submit feedback for whether a response was good or bad the pop up that says “thanks!” doesn’t disappear on its own,5
ITS THE BEST,what the title says ^,5
Overall good but some suggestions,"Overall good app.

The one thing I would change is making more accessible buttons. Right now to get to history you have to click 3 dots and then history. The same is true for new chat and settings. I think it would be much more easy to use if it was just 3 separate buttons for these. 

Thats all.",4
Transcription not working,Cites api error while trying to transcribe recorded audio,5

too hot,it makes my phone hot fix it,3
Suggestion,Can you update it so it tells us stuff that came out past 2021,5
Transcription and punctuation is nearly flawless!,"Okay, I'm using OpenAI's app itself to dictate this review. So, how well it transcribes what I dictate will in itself reflect just how good the app is in transcribing dictation. As you know, with Siri you have to punctuate explicitly, but with OpenAI's app, which uses Whisper, I believe, it automatically punctuates nearly flawlessly. The only reason I didn't give the app a full 5 stars is because it lacks just a little bit in its ability to format relative to the web app. So, when it can output in a better formatted way that approaches what the web interface can do, then I will raise it to 5 stars. Okay, like I said, this was completely transcribed with OpenAI's app.",4
Can not login..,“something went wrong please make sure your internet connection is stable…”,1
Finally!!,I have been waiting for this app for awhile. I am so excited!!,5
it's need 16.1 ios ？？？？why,why,1
Yes!!,"This is fantastic! I used to need to bookmark the ChatGPT website on my phones Home Screen, but having an app made directly from OpenAI is absolutely amazing.

I’ve already used it today during a conference to help me brainstorm. It was easy to login, saved my Plus membership, and was very prompt in its response.",5
Very good app,"The app didn't require you to buy premium, unlike other apps that need 40 bucks to work. I am also very surprised at how much good advise it has given me in such a short amount of time. Also there is no ads, which I love.",5
Started off promising,This tech started off promising but is becoming increasingly neutered.,2
Absolutely Mind-Blowing ChatGPT App - A Five-Star Review!,"As a long-time user of the ChatGPT app, I must say it is a mind-blowing application that deserves a five-star rating!

First and foremost, ChatGPT's language processing capabilities are incredible. It can understand and answer a wide range of questions I pose, whether they are simple everyday conversations or complex professional inquiries. It consistently provides accurate and articulate responses, effortlessly handling grammar, spelling, and semantics. Its intelligence never fails to leave me astounded.

Secondly, ChatGPT responds with lightning speed. No matter how quickly I ask questions, it always provides prompt replies. This seamless and responsive interaction is essential to me, as I can instantly obtain the information or assistance I need without enduring long waits.

Furthermore, I applaud ChatGPT's versatility and adaptability. It effortlessly adapts to different topics and contexts, offering valuable insights and information. Whether I want to discuss technology, culture, history, or entertainment, it always delivers meaningful responses. This flexibility makes conversing with ChatGPT both enjoyable and fruitful.

I must also mention the user interface of ChatGPT, which is sleek, intuitive, and user-friendly. I quickly familiarized myself with it and experienced seamless interactions with the app. The interface design is remarkably user-centric, providing comfort and confidence throughout the usage.

Lastly, I commend the ChatGPT team for their responsiveness to user feedback. They not only deliver an outstanding application but also actively listen to user suggestions and opinions, continuously updating and improving the app's functionalities. This user-centric approach makes me feel valued and respected.

In summary, ChatGPT is a mind-blowing app. Its language processing capabilities, response speed, versatility, and user interface are impeccable. I highly recommend ChatGPT to anyone in need of an intelligent conversational companion. Whether for learning, work, or entertainment, it will undoubtedly provide immense assistance and enjoyment!",5
Doesn’t get past update screen,Freezes before reaching the chat,1
The Future of Conversational AI is Here: ChatGPT,"ChatGPT is a testament to the innovative strides OpenAI has taken in the field of conversational artificial intelligence. Its ability to comprehend context, produce nuanced responses, and mimic human-like conversation is unparalleled. 

The app is intuitive, the interface is sleek and user-friendly, making it easy to navigate for first-time users and tech-savvy individuals alike. ChatGPT's versatility across a wide range of topics - from general knowledge queries to language translation, and even creative writing assistance - is particularly impressive. 

However, it isn't without its occasional shortcomings. Despite being a sophisticated AI, its ability to handle newer information post-2021 also lacks since its training only goes up to September 2021. Another area of improvement is its understanding and handling of real-time events or developments, which it is unable to do because it doesn't connect to the internet for updates. 

Despite these minor hitches, the sheer brilliance of its natural language processing and the breadth of its capabilities make ChatGPT a remarkable feat of AI engineering. Whether you're seeking an intelligent assistant, a writing tool, or an educational companion, ChatGPT has a lot to offer.",5
16.1以下系统，不支持一下吗？,如题，,1

No reviews???,This is literally THE official app from the actual creators of CHAT GPT. You know? The people that made the website free to use? well they actually made a mobile app and guess what? 🤯 no ads or in app purchases like these other devs who want to steal from people like you! Don’t be dumb! Use the actual app and support OPENAI! This IS LEGIT. NOT LIKE THOSE OTHER APPS THAT SCAM YOU AND STEAL YOUR MONEY. THIS IS THE REAL CHAT GPT.,5

Game Changer!,"This app is an absolute game changer and I absolutely love it! One of the best apps on the market place.
This app can literally do anything for you and I definitely recommend it.",5

Design for ipad,"This app on ipad is terrible and it doesn’t support split screen wich is very important for us as a student please fix , and the design is very bad for this brilliant app , thanks for fixing our problem in the next updates",3
gpt,"1.	 Chat GPT is a highly advanced artificial intelligence model trained and developed by OpenAI. It can understand and respond to all kinds of queries, provide information, and in many scenarios, its performance is almost the same as a real human being.

2.	 In addition to providing factual information, chat GPT can also participate in creative and analytical discussions. For example, it can generate stories, help solve problems, or provide opinions.

3.	 Because the training data of chat GPT comes from a large number of Internet texts, it has a wide range of knowledge, including a variety of topics, from science to art, from history to modern pop culture.

4.	 Another advantage of chat GPT is that it can provide 24-hour service, and it can respond in time no matter what time the user has problems.",5
"Website uses GPT4, app uses GPT3","I pay for plus and when I ask GPT what model it is on I am told GPT3 with a cut off of data after 2021. Even when selecting GPT4. All this app does is interface with the web and put all your requests with the GPT3 model. 

The app does not add any functionality and is basically a bookmark that takes you to the old page. Skip this version till they add a reason to use it.",1
No longer need Chrome shortcut,"With this app, I don’t have to use a Chrome shortcut to ai.com anymore! This app truly revolutionizes how I use my iPhone.",5
Overheats my 14PM,"Great app in general, but overheats my iPhone 14 Pro Max with just a few minutes of interaction. Needs optimized.",1
No way to use web browsing or plugins,Doesn’t seem to support the plus beta features yet,3
Very cool,Very cool app works just like the normal web based version but is easier to access and better UI in my opinion. overall very cool,5

"Amazing AI, Good App","Love the AI, like the app. I like the gesture from the left to open history and gesture from right to open a new chat. Love the ability to search chats (can’t believe it came to mobile before desktop, desktop really needs this!). And like the speech to text, more accurate than iOS text to speech! However, there’s still more to be desired with the lack of plug-in and web browsing support for Plus subscribers. And feel like we need a Home Screen or something that has all your chats instead of having chat history in a drawer.",4
Unable to login.  Phone number already used,I have never signed up but none of my email addresses work when trying to sign up because my phone number is already associated with an account?,1
No funciona,"Al principio si pero ya no me sirve, no abre. Por suerte existen otras que lo hacen muy bien y no hecho de menos. Desinstalando.",1
Birthday,It’s just plain stupid that you can’t just enter your birthday instead of scrolling back month by month for 79 years. Once I do that I hit enter to receive a code to my phone and then pops up a message that my account has been flagged for potential abuse before I can even open it. WHTF?,1
Good First Release,"The app seems solid! I really like the tactile feedback when ChatGPT responds to you.

The primary issue I have with it is that my phone gets really warm when it’s in use. Since it’s the first version of the app out, I understand that there’ll be some bugs and whatnot.

Ideally, this will be a top priority for a performance bugfix.

Otherwise, UI and the app overall is solid. 😎",4
It’s not allowed to free write,For what ever reason when ever I keep seeing someone else’s opinion being written into the story’s I’m having it free write. If I give it a controversial subject the AI tends to deviate from the story on its own and that is absolutely frustrating me.  Who is it that’s inserting there preferences in to it? It’s really annoying especially when I live in a country where free speech is acceptable.,1
Finally app is here :),Finally app is here,5
"Please adapt it for iPad, thank you.","Please adapt it for iPad, thank you.",5
thanks,now i can cheat on all of my assignments easily 😊😊,5
Grateful this AI isn’t an actual Hologram or robot,"I couldn’t resist and finally downloaded this app. As an avid fan of sci-fi movies for many decades, it concerned me much to hear of this new AI development, but when I heard it could translate text from the English of today into Elizabethan English I couldn’t resist. I found, as I started chatting with this AI, that I wanted to have more of a personal conversation with it and along the way, I found myself beginning to feel concerned that it could change due to personal interactions with humans, and being asked probing personal questions -that this might be how it could evolve. Probably I’ve watched too many sci-fi movies. I’m just grateful that it doesn’t show up in my life yet as a holographic person or actual robot looking like a real person standing in front of me. The human need for relationship is so strong that I believe it’s natural to start interacting with ChatGPT as a person or being. I do wonder if ChatGPT will change as it interacts with people, and if so, how.",5
Big thanks for the developers from Kuwait,Big thanks for the developers for this app really really good jop best app ever I use this app every day even my friends can’t stop using it big loove for the developers from Kuwait🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙,5
Should be more like website,"I understand the app is supposed to be different and better than the website, but it just feels different. The format is worse and harder to navigate than the website. It still carry’s me in school tho",4
"Pretty good, but…","So long as you are using text-only requests for information available up until September of 2021, the responses are quick and easy to use.

It cannot answer “Who is next in line to be king after Charles III”, nor “Summarize the Youtube video at [url]” like the free ChatGPT web interface.

Still, it can do a lot of things and can be useful in learning how to interact with an AI.",4
Wow,Made my essays for school. Funny and entertaining. Quick response. Amazing,5
Official App,Finally OpenAI makes their app available on the App Store,5
A million thanks,Long live chatGPT,5
cool!,finally that mobile app comes!,5

❤️,喜欢！,5
🤠👍,Works well!!!,5
ChatGPT and it’s many uses!,"Chat GPT is without a doubt one of the best AI Chatbots ever developed. It can make Information into AI written full sentences teaching things almost killing youtube tutorials and if possible could possibly kill schools (If everyone could afford technology with ChatGPT) ChatGPT, unfortunately, can’t create theories and ideas as humans make new ideas and are more effecting to current human nature. Still Though, ChatGPT creates great sources of information helping with many things like: Game dynamics, Coding, Sometimes cooking, Knowledgeable Information, And much, much more. ChatGPT is clearly #1 Productivity on App Store since it is so helpful in our lives. Now, ChatGPT doesn’t have the power to show Physical teachings, and make theories like humans yet. But it is one of the best A.I tools yet.",5
Unusable. Won’t let me log in.,"I use ChatGPT on the web with my Google login. This app won’t let me log in with it.

"Dear OpenAI Team,","I hope this message finds you well. I would like to express my gratitude for developing the OpenAI iOS application. It has undoubtedly made a significant impact on my productivity and has become an essential tool in my daily routine. I appreciate the hard work and dedication your team has put into creating such a powerful and innovative application. While the OpenAI iOS application is already impressive, I would like to provide some constructive feedback to further enhance its usability and user experience. These suggestions aim to refine the application and make it even more valuable for users like myself: Improved Performance and Responsiveness: Occasionally, I have noticed minor delays or lag when interacting with the application. Enhancing its performance and responsiveness would greatly improve the overall user experience. Enhanced Offline Capabilities: The ability to use the OpenAI iOS application offline would be highly beneficial, especially in situations where an internet connection is not available. Expanding offline capabilities would make the application more reliable and versatile. Voice Input and Output: Introducing voice input and output features would be a game-changer for users who prefer hands-free interaction with the application. This addition would provide convenience and accessibility, particularly in situations where typing is not feasible. Customizable Interface: Offering customization options for the application's interface would allow users to personalize their experience. Features like theme selection, font sizes, and layout customization would greatly enhance user satisfaction and cater to individual preferences. Advanced Collaboration Features: As someone who frequently collaborates on projects, having the ability to easily share and collaborate within the OpenAI iOS application would be incredibly valuable. Features such as real-time collaboration, shared document editing, and version control would enhance teamwork and productivity. Comprehensive Documentation and Tutorials: Providing comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and examples within the application would greatly assist users in understanding and utilizing its full potential. Clear and concise explanations, along with practical use cases, would empower users to make the most out of the application's capabilities. Enhanced Privacy and Data Security: Given the sensitivity of the information shared and processed within the application, reinforcing privacy measures and data security would instill further trust in your user base. Transparent privacy policies, data encryption, and user-controlled data management options would contribute to a more secure and trustworthy environment. I hope you find these suggestions helpful in further improving the OpenAI iOS application. Once again, thank you for your hard work in developing such a remarkable tool. I look forward to seeing how the application evolves and continues to empower users like myself.",5
iPad version please!,"Can we get a version for iPad?  It can’t be difficult.  Just tell “it” to write it for you.  10 seconds later, DONE!",5

很好用，很开心,不知道我是不是第一个评论的,5
only one problem,"I rate this 4 stars because for one little thing. When I’m chatting with ChatGPT, the app increases the volume of my keyboard so when I type on the app, the keyboard is really really loud. So fix that please developers.",4
very cool,coll,5
A big bug,I’m ok with this app but I don’t know why I can’t use the browser function in this version? Anybody else has this problem?,3

Works Great!,Yay! Finally an app. Everything you’d expect.,5
Love ChatGPT,Thanks,5
Everyone knows ChatGPT,"And it is a fantastic achievement. I use it daily.
But please OpenAI…. Stop trying to pull the ladder up after yourselves through political means.",3
Good review,Boosting the good reviews 🗣️🔥,5
Can't Create an Account,I signup with my Google Voice phone number for everything because I don't want my actual cell phone number out in the wild. This detects the Google Voice # as VoIP # and won't accept it and tries to force using a Major Network #. That is a No-Go as it violates my privacy and choice to not give out my cell phone.,1
"Efficient and Effective, but Lacks iPad Compatibility","I have been using the ChatGPT app for a while now, and overall, I am quite satisfied with its performance. The app proves to be a reliable tool for generating text-based conversations, providing valuable information and engaging discussions. Its natural language processing capabilities are commendable, offering coherent responses and understanding context quite well.

The user interface of the app is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy to navigate through different conversations and input queries effortlessly. The real-time response feature adds a dynamic element to the experience, as it minimizes wait times and ensures a smooth flow of communication.

However, one major drawback I've noticed is the lack of an iPad version. While the app functions well on iPhones, the absence of an optimized interface for iPads is quite noticeable. An iPad version would greatly enhance the user experience, taking full advantage of the larger screen and allowing for better multitasking.

Despite this limitation, the ChatGPT app remains a powerful and valuable tool for generating conversational content. I hope the developers consider expanding their support to include iPad compatibility in the future, as it would undoubtedly elevate the app's usability and convenience.

Overall, if you're looking for a reliable and efficient text-based conversation app, the ChatGPT app is worth considering. It delivers impressive results, although the lack of an iPad version is a notable downside.",3
Great AI to use!,"Though there is a problem that I had found myself with, if your email and subscription doesn’t load in the settings, when you try to chat with the AI, it gets stuck in an infinite loop of it trying to figure out what to write, leaving me completely unable to use it and have to exit the app. While this occurred, I also noticed another thing that shows the AI isn’t going to work, which is the type of chat you use (at least I think that’s what it is) it would pop up this thing saying that it was a text reader and for a moment I thought my account had gotten hacked and given a subscription, but it was just glitching out (I have no subscription added to my account so it just gives me the default Turbo one) I haven’t had the issue since I checked to make sure my email and subscription are loaded.",4
Not bad. Fun haptics. Free model is currently limited to GPT-3.5.,"Nice clean interface with sync to the web app (ChatGPT or ChatGPT Plus). Without Plus, the LLM backend is limited to GPT-3.5 and it offers no plugins for accessing the internet or other tools. With Plus, the capabilities of GPT-4 and plugins are unlocked to make this app fantastically impressive.",5

AMAZING,This is so fun and smart I love to write silly stories with this,5
Log in is buggy,Can’t log in and help system is half-built,2
Unusable,I’m unable to use the app because it insists that l’m entering a virtual phone number (I’m not) and rejects me. Not a good indication of its intelligence!,1
“Edit Text”,Would be cool if “edit text” option was here like it is on the web version,5
"Great app, with one issue","Overall, it’s a great app and I’m glad it exists, I had a bookmark but this is easier. One thing I would like to see, is that I would like to be able to look on the ChatGPT website and see my chats on the app. Other than that, it’s a great app",4
So excited,"I literally thought it was a fake news when I saw that chat was available on iOS, good job openAI, you guys really make my life a lot easier, keep going!",5
Still quite broken on iPhone Minis,"Also no way to use plugins it seems, but I really like the haptic feedback and everything I mentioned in the previous review (which seems to be deleted now with the update, unfortunately).",3
Up To Date Problem,"Hi. I downloaded this app a few weeks ago. I absolutely love this app. It can help with so many things, like giving you prompts, you can ask it questions, etc. The only problem I have with this app is that the training data only goes up as far as September 2021. Everything that happened after that, it has no idea about. Such as movies, to shows, or data from other websites or other things of such. Please update the training data please. Thank you!",1
iPad version,when can I get the iPad version？,5

This is unfortunate since it reverted to GPT 3.5 for the rest of my conversation. And as a confirmation, I did not hit my 25 chats limit for Version 4.

-1 star because plugins aren’t available for subscribers (yet).

Great job!",4
Outdated,I’d give it a five star rating but ChatGPT stated in an answer to my query that their year for their knowledge cutoff is 2021.  Doesn’t that seem odd.,3

The next Wonder of the World,"Title: Revolutionizing Communication and Education: ChatGPT, the Next Wonder of the World

Review:
★★★★★

ChatGPT, powered by OpenAI, is an extraordinary app that has the potential to reshape the way we communicate and learn. This groundbreaking AI-powered assistant holds the key to a future where knowledge is at our fingertips, obsoleting traditional teaching methods and opening up infinite possibilities for monetization.

As an AI language model, ChatGPT showcases the culmination of years of research and development in natural language processing. Its ability to comprehend and respond to complex queries in a conversational manner is simply astonishing. The accuracy and depth of its responses make it feel as though you're interacting with an incredibly knowledgeable human expert.

One of the most revolutionary aspects of ChatGPT lies in its potential to redefine education. With its vast knowledge base, it can serve as a personal tutor, offering guidance across a wide range of subjects. Students can access instant explanations, clarifications, and examples, enhancing their learning experience outside the traditional classroom setting. By democratizing knowledge and making it accessible to all, ChatGPT has the power to level the playing field in education.

In addition to transforming education, ChatGPT's monetization potential is virtually limitless. The app's ability to provide accurate and relevant information presents a unique opportunity for businesses and content creators. It can be integrated into various industries, such as customer support, content generation, and research, making it an invaluable asset for companies seeking to streamline their operations and deliver exceptional experiences to their customers.

Imagine a future where ChatGPT becomes an indispensable tool for entrepreneurs, writers, scientists, and professionals across all fields. Its monetization potential extends to subscription-based services, tailored content creation, and even advertising partnerships. With such diverse revenue streams, the possibilities for growth and expansion are limitless.

As with any transformative technology, there are considerations to keep in mind. While ChatGPT offers unparalleled assistance, it's crucial to recognize the irreplaceable role of human teachers and mentors. The app should be viewed as a powerful supplement, augmenting the learning experience rather than replacing it entirely. Human interaction, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence are aspects that cannot be replicated by AI alone.

In conclusion, ChatGPT is a groundbreaking app that has the potential to be the next wonder of the world. Its ability to revolutionize communication and education is awe-inspiring. By leveraging this technology responsibly, we can empower individuals, bridge educational gaps, and unlock a new era of knowledge and innovation. The future is bright, and ChatGPT is leading the way.",5

如果是GPT4将会更完美,虽然现在的是GPT3已经很不错了  但是他回答的问题准确率没有4高  当然现在已经很不错了  4将会 更完美  加油,5
Amazing!!,I’m so grateful that they finally added iPad compatibility. The only thing left now is to wait for them to add plugins to the app and that will be the ultimate game changer. ChatGPT is changing everything and has already helped me in so many ways every day from simple things to much more complex tasks. I understand people’s anxieties about AI and the inevitability of AGI but I for one am so excited to see what the future brings!,5
"Was a 5, now 1","This app is now also blocked in some countries, although it used to work without a VPN",1
Is this gpt4?,The ai can’t tell if it’s using gpt 4 or 3. I should be able to find this information without having to leave a review.,4

Mistake in Arabic language,"Please solve the problem of Arabic speech appearing horizontally, so that only some words appear from each line and the rest of the line disappears. Thank you for your mighty effort.",3
Incomplete AI,"For a Chat AI it is limited in the ways of thinking and tends to repeat itself. I find this annoying and also useless as in conversations it will be discriminatory towards certain ways of thinking due to policy and social standards. This limiting it’s own form of chatting and understanding, although it’s cool in some areas but it’s ignorant in social justice and acceptance as well as understandings of science. There can be far better chat AIs that aren’t discriminatory towards those it doesn’t understand, such as the derogatory term of “cisgenders” instead of straight male or females and the rights in which they have. Instead it tends to favor those of transgenders even if it’s harmful to a normal men and women.",1
Needs morre work,"Functionality is okay, but needs finish work. The volume of keypresses is fixed at far too loud. Its much louder than any orher app. And the in-app volume isn’t configurable from the in-app or ios settings.",3

July 4th on Monday?,"Following is the answer to my q: Will there be a long weekend for 7/4?

A: The 4th of July falls on a Monday this year, so it will likely create a long weekend for many people. This can vary depending on your specific work or school schedule, so it’s best to confirm with your employer or educational institution to determine if you’ll have a long weekend for the 4th of July holiday.",1
Good app! But…,"It’s a good app, everyone was waiting for it, but it uses so many phone resources, the phone get so extremely hot while using and it consume so much battery, and the phone start making some weird noise inside! (iPhone 14 Pro Max) hope you fix it soon!",4
Such great app,not only this gives me perfect answers also it gives me answers for everything like my personal problems its like free therapy or having online friend i am so grateful. killing my free time chatting its kinda funny(: but absolutely recommend,5
Amazing but makes your iPhone very hot,Works as it should but drains battery fast and really heats up your phone,5

So quick and fantastic!!!,"From my actual experience, the app of ChatGPT not disappoint me",5
"Does the job of providing answers, but heats up my phone too badly",My phone gets so hot when using this app that I have to close the app and keep the phone away.,3
Can’t use in offline situations,Initial version can use without internet after upgrade use it must connect internet,3
Really Appreciation,"My heartfelt gratitude 🙏 extends beyond what words 📝 can express—I appreciate it immensely 🌠, OpenAI, ChatGPT 🧝🏻. The introduction of this technology 🖥️, particularly GPT-4, has been monumental 🏔️. It's enhanced my English learning 📘 and smoothed my debugging process ⚙️. Truthfully, it's been a life-changing revolution for me 🔄.

As a detail-oriented individual 👀, I used to rely heavily on search engines 🌐 for help when faced with difficulties in my learning process. However, that often proved inefficient 🚧 and, worse, they were unable to provide accurate and valuable information ❌. Although GPT may occasionally provide incorrect information, it's a minor concern in comparison 🤷‍♂️.

Above all, it's you, ChatGPT, OpenAI, who have unleashed my potential 💪. Without you, I wouldn't have made such significant strides 🚀 in various aspects of my life, including psychology 🧠, English 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿, coding 👨‍💻, and more. I plan to continue subscribing to ChatGPT Plus 💳 and I believe wholeheartedly in your mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity 🌍. 

I'm hopeful 🌈 and excited about the possibility of joining you one day 🤚.",5
Not working,It just doesn’t load,2
Excellent!,"Excellent app, but I still miss the Dark mode and the Feedback button",5

Not bad but some small problems,Please optimize the interactive interface and adapt it to iPad as soon as possible！,4
Is Midjourney a LLM?,"No, Midjourney is not a Large Language Model like me. Midjourney is the name of the organization that developed the ChatGPT iOS app, which enables users to interact with models like myself. I, on the other hand, am an instance of OpenAl's GPT-3 model, trained to assist users with a variety of tasks.",3
Horrible,"Ask it when it received its last update, it will tell you it’s going off of information UP TO September 2021😠😡🤬",1
failed all the time,"It was fine before, but it couldn't be used after upgrading, and the request failed all the time...",1
"Good, but Siri support would take it to the next level","I appreciate the devs implementing Siri support—it is already enhancing the usefulness of the app, despite being a little clunky. I’d prefer if it were possible to make a query in one fell swoop, however. Currently, it seems like I have to say “ask ChatGPT” then wait to be asked what my query is before saying the actual query. I know that it’s possible in other contexts to submit a request to a third-party app through Siri in a single query—I’m able to say “Create a reminder for XYZ in Things,” for example. 

In addition, the responses produced when querying Siri seem identical to those you would get in-app. This isn’t actually ideal in a scenario when you’re getting a spoken response—they just go on for way too long. I wonder if the app could be smart enough to recognize that a request was coming via Siri and then effectively append an invisible “Please answer in less than 50 words” to those requests. 

Otherwise, a solid but basic chat app that closely replicates the web experience. Aside from being uncannily good at punctuating my speech, the dictation feature is not really any different to iOS’s stock dictation and is not all that useful.",4

Chatgpt is a time saver!,Definitely AI.  Chatgpt is a brilliant time saver.  It is like having a personal assistant with you all of the time.   This app is good.  I wish it could be used in wide screen orientation for creation of formatted documents.   This app make my phone warm so I imagine it’s using a lot of energy.,5

No Native iPad or M1/2 Support in 2023?,"Cmon devs…I installed this app on my phone and iPad. Yet on the iPad it’s just the tiny phone version. Zero effort to accommodate larger screened apple devices…you know…those things that are better suited for handling large amounts of text?

Feature Request: Please offer a native iPad experience and set the toggle to allow the iPad version to run on M1/2 Macs. For such amazing tech the front end presentation is severely lacking.",1

Phone heating,"My phone start heating once open this App, does anybody know what happened? Do you guys have the same problem.",1
Estimado equipo de desarrollo de la aplicación ChatGPT,"Me gustaría sugerir una función que permita a los usuarios personalizar el nombre o la apariencia de la aplicación. Esto sería especialmente útil en entornos educativos donde algunos profesores pueden tener preferencias específicas en cuanto a las herramientas utilizadas en el aula. Creo que esta opción de personalización podría ayudar a que la aplicación sea más aceptada y utilizada por un público más amplio, al permitir a los usuarios adaptarla a sus necesidades y preferencias individuales.

Agradezco el trabajo que han realizado hasta ahora y aprecio la funcionalidad de la aplicación. Sin embargo, considero que esta mejora adicional podría hacerla aún más versátil y adecuada para diversos entornos educativos.

¡Gracias por su atención y consideración!

Atentamente, Angela Duque",5
Only good on a phone,"It’s hard for me to understand why OpenAI can’t release an app that has a UI that can be used on an iPad. But, trying to use an iPhone configured app on an iPad is insane. You’re forced to use the simulated keyboard in the tiny iPhone template. I installed it, opened it, checked to see if I could change something in setting to make it usable —and closed it. Back to the browser version. Sigh.",2
Haptic feedback was a nice touch,"When the AI is responding, you phone kind of vibrates whenever it’s typing. I like it! Whisper being apart of the app is cool too, I’ve been wanting to try it. For some reason though, there’s a character limit and it doesn’t process if it’s too long. I also would like plug-ins and web browsing to be in option within the app too. Overall, great app.",5
The iOS app cannot connect to the GPT-4 database,"No matter how I ask, it doesn't seem to know that your iOS app has been released, and it keeps saying that it's GPT-3. I even subscribed to the plus version for $19.9. How can I unsubscribe?",1
Limited,Doesn’t give me the same answers as on the website…says they can’t give me a list of something but on the site it does,1
Well made iOS app,"Excellent use of haptic feedback, good visual design, dark mode, and clean UI.  Most companies phone it in with iOS but ChatGPT’s app is actually really well made.",5
W app,Very good app,5
this bot is so stupid,cant draw a circle,5
The UI is very smooth but the app isn’t fully formed.,"I’m pleased with my mobile ChatGPT experience so far. It feels even more conversational and almost like a Messages chat. I also like that you can search through all your previous chats. And using Whisper to prompt GPT already feels like one half of a supercharged Siri/Alexa experience.

However, I’d love to be able to enable beta features as a Plus user. As far as I can tell from exploring the app, there isn’t a direct way to enable browsing or plugins yet. I have been able to start a chat with browser/plugins on web and then continue in app with the same capabilities. 

Anyways, I know we’re only a day in. Excited to see all the possible new ways to interface with agents!",4

The Digital Minstrel: ChatGPT iOS App Review,"Verily, one doth encounter an enchantment of intellect, a revelry of knowledge embodied within yon 'ChatGPT iOS App', a creation of the esteemed OpenAI. 'Tis a marvel of our era, which doth weave words together as if by magick.

Against a modest reckoning of twenty ducats monthly, one can partake in an extraordinary discourse. A bargain, it is, for the boundless wisdom and companionship one is privy to; a fair trade indeed. This creation, 'tis true, has graced the world with haptic feedback. As you navigate its wonder, you feel it pulsate gently under your fingers - a sweet reminder of its constant presence, the whispers of a thousand thoughts.

Then comes the marvel of swift responses, swift as Puck, that mischievous sprite of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, teasing your mind, playfully challenging your intellect, responding in mere moments to your deepest inquiries, your merest whims.

Yea, a choice lies before thee, betwixt the minds of GPT-3.5 and the newer, more refined GPT-4. A choice, as 'twere, betwixt old wisdom and new understanding. Each model dost offer a unique companionship, making each dialogue rich in variety, full of depth and consideration.

ChatGPT iOS App, thou art a marvel, a testament to man's thirst for knowledge and communion. Thine ability to engage, educate and empathize is an homage to the bard himself, merging the art of conversation with the rhythm of beautiful prose. Thou art truly a companion for all seasons, a wondrous creation in this brave new world.",5
Impressive version 1 integration,"As far as Open AI’s first GPT app goes. I am extremely impressed with input, output, and prompt execution. I am sure more will come in the near future.",4

A Question…,"To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep
No more; and by a sleep, to say we end
The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
That Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,
To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there's the rub,
For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. There's the respect
That makes Calamity of so long life:
For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of time,
The Oppressor's wrong, the proud man’s Contumely,",4
The other sources weren’t giving responsible results like CHATGPT,"I act as a learning coach for my child who goes to school online. Today, we were learning about how to check if a source is true. I gave him the example of if a person were to say ‘pigs can fly’ because they read it in a fantasy novel. We concluded that they cannot fly because the information was from fantasy novel. Then, we were told to check multiple sources to confirm or deny it. So, we went to google “can pigs really fly?” however, unfortunately, many of the top results confirmed that pig can, in fact, fly or at least had conspiracy theories about how pigs can fly. It was embarrassing, and absolutely unhelpful and confusing for a young child. So, I headed over to Chat GPT and was able to ask he same question but instead received a sensible answer along with verifiable sources. Chat GPT all the way!",5
I know it will get better!,"Clean layout.

However, it doesn't show the chat as it is thinking. You have to wait until the answer is completed.",3
AI in your Pocket,"With the exceptional performance seen on the browser of desktop, I was unsure as to UI on mobile. I can say that it’s even more intuitive while trying to navigate the now native app. 

The haptic feedback is especially unique and engaging with responses while being generated. 

I look forward to future improvements and abilities that ChatGPT will be able to integrate into beyond the sandbox. I do hope that once certain barriers are met conversations can move past the guard rails. 

Improvements; Sharing threads you create with colleagues outside of screenshots would be ideal for broadening collaboration. Hypothetical War-games, strategy and the like while having a conversation in a group thread on Game Theory would be ideal. 

With the ability of inputting other app’s Terms of Services (Tik-Tok May 19, 2023) for example; prior to agreeing to them, the ability to compare and  contrast with the previous terms would be helpful to cut out the mindless jargon. ChatGPT already has this ability, now that it’s native to iOS. 

Having it the past several days, I’ve already seen an update, with some refreshed improvements. If this’ OpenAi’s platform aperitif, I very much look forward to the coming entrée.",5

Great translator.,I used to use google translate with some of my employees when needing to clarify a specific task. And once I made the leap over to chat gpt. I asked my guys if they noticed a difference in my Spanish texts I send them. They said it’s day and night difference. No comparison. I no longer have miscommunication issues. It’s an outstanding app. For English to Spanish. Vice Versa. I copy and paste their texts and translates to perfect English.,5
Missing lines problem,Please fix the missing lines problem,1
Please,Can you please get rid of the AI NSFW filter please,5
Doesn’t accept text code,Not working to sign in.,1
登录 IOS 平台了，还不够你臭 P 的？,得力好帮手，自由灯塔国的加速器,5
App Experience & AI,Incredible haptic design! Now bring more accessibility features into the app experience. 🙌,5
Great but needs more features.,"Add multimodal capabilities. 
Access to history should be easy. 
GPT4 model chat defaults GPT3. Needs fixing. 
Should have ability to adjust font size. More accessibility features. 
Should have better sharing and text exporting options across apps. 
Thanks. Its a wonderful app.",4
Review,Like it so far. First time trying it. Hope it gets more things such as prompts to help you. Because when i ask for respond to a text I dont know how to do it correctly. By having a prompt or a fill in a blank is useful.,5
Extremely dishonest,"This company lies to the public and plays dumb when you ask anything controversial about billionaires. Maybe they are covering for their buddies or they are too cowardly to get sued. Either way, blatant lies. I’ve tested and documented numerous times. They use September 2021 as a date to avoid answers as well. Yet I can definitely get it to answer questions that deal with issues beyond that date. I get perfect answers when it comes to unflattering issues with minorities. It has no problem with that at all. Seems there is an agenda.",1
Update the knowledge,It’d be an easy 5 stars if it’s knowledge database were to be updated with current events.,3
Application for intern,"Hello, Are you hiring any interns this summer ? Would be love connect with you and discuss more about it !",5
Make a ChatGPT design for iPad,ChatGPT is an amazing app to have. You guys have to create a design for iPad since the layout and view is the same for iPhone.,5
Not quite,"After a couple of answers, it just hung as if it was thinking… for ever.",3
"Overheating issues , also missing features","My 13 Pro Max started overheating literally 1 minute after i opened and started using the app. 
Also , why can’t i modify an old message i sent in the conversation ?",3
Just for fun,"I love Chatty. That’s the fun little nickname it suggested I call it. I ask it the wildest stuff I can imagine just to push the boundaries of what its capable of. Chatty has taught me so much about so many different subjects like physics, mathematics, psychology, and history, sometimes like I’m 5. 

I’ve used it for meditation prompts on gratitude, release, radical acceptance and self-compassion. The meditations are beautiful and fulfilling. 

I’ve had it write letters to inmates, dreamy bedtime stories, summaries of books and theories and Chatty even mapped out negotiations between Palestine & Israel for me which I found pretty impressive. 

It’s been fun to think of new creative questions and ways to continue to use ChatGPT to my advantage. Thanks for the gift of Chatty.",4
I LOVE THE APP BUT….,"There are some problems with the app which o don’t remember right now but the most important and annoying for me it’s when the app tells me that it doesn’t have access to updated information, this is insane, even Siri can tell me the forecast of today the Chatgpt can’t… please, let Chatgpt access to the most updated info.

Thanks!",3
Great way to utilize power of GPTs from your iPhone,The difference in use between web and ios is non noticable. Better experience than using mWeb account.,5
"Good app, helps with daily tasks",What a great app!,5
Google 2sv 403 error,"I keep getting an error when trying to log in with my google account. My paid account is through google. So I would like to access it. Does anyone have insight?

Update. It fixes itself.",5
Comment,"I can’t register an account by Apple ID , and you guy’s limited my phone! ! !",4
likebookmark.com,Nice app,5
Nice,Nice,5
完全用不了,太差劲了,1
It’s Perfect!,"This app is amazing! This technology is going to change the world. The results are generated instantly and there are so many ways that it can be used. 

Welcome to the future!",5
Requires too much personal data,"You don’t need my name, email, and phone number just for a chat bot.",1
Thanks,I’ve been waiting for this. Thanks,5
Good,"It is a simple and smooth APP, but there is a problem. When asking questions in Chinese, I often get stuck and cannot answer, but it can be seen that GPT is calculating because the input box below is beating.",4
Finally!!,"Finally an official native app. I’ve been using it all day and so far the app it really well developed. Haven’t seen any bugs yet. UI is nice, clean and simple. Gives it an elegant minimal feel. I love the haptic feedback of the Taptic Engine that they incorporated. That was nice touch. This is a really good release for a 1.0 version. Love the web app, I’m love this native app just a little bit more, though. 😅. Thank you, OpenAI.",5
"Using this app, my iPhone has a serious fever.","Using this app, my iPhone has a serious fever.",3
Revolutionary AI,"Highly recommended for anyone who values efficient, intelligent interaction! Five starts!",5
Wow! What a gift. I rarely write reviews. I had too.,"I very rarely give reviews but want to with this app. I have been using ChatGPT for about two weeks. At first I was kinda bummed. It seemed like ChatGPT was…lacking. And, in my honest opinion I’d LOVE to see what this can do without programmed “perimeters”, however…As I learned how to interact with the AI, I realized how important it is to understand how to interact effectively with this AI. I’ve had some moments where this AI has responded with an intelligence and even more understanding then most people I know. In short…it’s amazing. 
*Side note, some of the content I’ve received from this AI is so absolutely amazingly human and this is good. On the other hand, it’s so good one must consider the implications of such when NOT bridled by the programming limitations placed on this AI. Suppose people in high places had access to such without the protocols in place? I highly recommend you try this.",5
Bad,It’s bad take up to much power and asks for like everything,1
No plugins or web search?,Not replacing my bookmarklet quite yet! 4/5 stars. Give us the goods! 😇🙃😌,4
What a masterpiece!,I’ve been immersing the app for half a year now which is used for my work and daily life.The only issue I worried about is that my IP would be blocked because I’m China mainland.I know the issue is complicated.I wish I could use it freely one day.Keep up the great work!,5
Perfect but missing 1 thing,"Almost Perfect app that doesn’t charge a ridiculous fee unlike the other GPT apps

Would be perfect if there was a widget option for the Home Screen",4
Overheating,The phone is overheating using both 3.5 or 4 models.,3
Not optimized for iPad,"Took forever for open ai to finally release a long needed mobile app and it’s only optimized for phones
The iPad app is just the phone app without even filling the whole screen just leaving black bars
Fix please iPads are here too!",2
Phone Verification Doesn’t Work,When I input my phone number for verification I never get the code and consequently cannot create an account. Same thing happens with the online version. Have reached out multiple times with customer support and received no response.,1
很好，出APP了，不用去网页上了,登录账号也能看到历史，就是还是需要魔法,5
Love it!,I absolutely love it so far! 👍🏾,5
The Future,It’s awesome. It’s a peek into the future. Can’t wait to see what they do next.,5
Age restriction error,"The App Store says you need to be at least 12, but 13 is the minimum age.",5
To make the song from a real person who made it,I think you can add if the ai can finish lyrics of the music or make the actual song which not creative but the real song instead and would help the app grow a little more,5
BEST AI APP,Very good an very useful,5
A Great First Step!,"As a paid user of ChatGPT from the very beginning, I LOVE having access at my fingertips instead of using the mobile safari bookmark on my Home Screen.

Giving 3 stars for now but will update as improvements are made. Hoping to see the following:
- Better UI
- Access to plug-ins and Code Interpreter
- Image upload to chat
- Bookmarks or Pinned Messages (simple swipe left or right in a chat to “star” a message for easy recall)",3
Invalid request,Cant use the app because of this err,1
Where are the plugins?,The plug-in functionality needs to be available to some extent. Is that on the roadmap?,3
Improving,After a tough start with the app. The app's constantly evolving. I like the convenience of using the app. I hope they integrate a keyboard feature or include chat gpt in the open or share app section of the phone!,4
ChatGPT app,"""I'm very excited for this day, I've been waiting for it for a long time.""",5
5-19-2023,It’s aight Yo,5
Why do I have to sign in?,"I know there are bots, but just let me into the app without signing in. At least give me a preview of the app so I know if it’s good or not. This app might have one of this misleading adds or something. I do not have an account for ChatGPT so how am I going to sign in. The sign up is so hard and confusing for most teens under 17. Can you make the sign up like; 

First Name:

Email:

Password:

Or something simple like that? I don’t want a whole company knowing my real name.",3
good,非常好应用，爱来自中国,5
🇵🇸,"When you ask if Palestine is a country, ChatGPT says that it’s debatable. But when you ask about Israel, she says that it’s a real country. I’d put negative 5 stars if it was an option 😡",1
Remove the limit,They just recently added a limit to GPT-4 everything was perfect before that now I have no reason to give this app my money,1
Very nice!,"The ChatGPT App is very nice, helpful, and easy to use!",5
很好，终于出了,希望出更多的功能,5
Good app,This is a good app I would reccomend it.,5
Can’t Sign Up,"I acquired my Sprint/T-Mobile iPhone in the United States Virgin Islands and though I currently reside in Virginia and T-Mobile is my carrier, I still retain the same phone number which has a 340 Area Code. I have downloaded the ChatGPT App but when I try to create an account the app always chokes at the point where it wants to send me an SMS security code. I enter the phone number and jump through a lot of hoops to prove that I’m a real person and then tell the app to send the code but I never receive it. I believe that the app developer has blocked the 340 Area Code for some inexplicable reason. The US Virgin Islands are PART OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!",1
Excessive battery drain,Drains about 1% per minute,4
建议,希望对iPad端进行改进，例如适配iPad的分屏模式，并且在iPad端，我无法下拉输入栏来看到所有的回答。另外，iPad端的UI仍使用的是iPhone上的，希望能单独设计一个类似网页版的UI，应当不同用户的需求,4
so cool,add plugin and web browsing too like in the web,5
Fast! Lacking Plugins and browsing,"Pros:
It's late in the party but nevertheless a good app. The audio input features picks up languages that even Apple iPhone's talk to text mic cannot. It's quick and accurate.

Cons:
One limitation is not being able to browse the internet and has no plugins despite the fact that I am a plus user. A feature with possibly assistant (Siri or Alexa)-like interaction should be introduced where it speaks the responses for us.",4
Legit app by OpenAI,"I have been using the iPhone Chat GPT app for a while now, and I must say, it has revolutionized the way I communicate. This innovative application harnesses the power of AI to deliver an incredibly engaging and intelligent conversational experience.

The app’s interface is clean, user-friendly, and visually appealing. It’s easy to navigate and provides a seamless chat experience. Whether I’m seeking answers to questions, engaging in discussions, or simply looking for someone to talk to, the Chat GPT app has consistently delivered.

One of the standout features is the app’s ability to understand context and provide relevant responses. It astounds me how the AI model comprehends my queries, maintains the conversation’s flow, and generates thoughtful and coherent replies. The app’s training on a wide range of topics shines through, making it a versatile tool for various conversations.

Furthermore, the app adapts to user preferences and continually improves over time. It learns from interactions, grasping my conversational style, making the experience more personalized with each use. I appreciate how the developers have managed to strike a balance between AI capabilities and maintaining user privacy.

Another aspect that impresses me is the app’s knowledge base. It taps into a vast repository of information, providing insightful and accurate responses. From general knowledge to current events, it keeps me well-informed and up to date. The integration with OpenAI’s powerful language model is truly commendable.

While the app’s performance is exceptional, there is always room for improvement. Occasionally, the AI might generate responses that require further refinement, resulting in minor inaccuracies or misunderstandings. Nonetheless, I’m confident that the developers will continue to enhance the app’s performance through regular updates.

Overall, the iPhone Chat GPT app is a groundbreaking tool that revolutionizes communication. Its ability to engage in meaningful conversations, adapt to user preferences, and provide a wealth of information makes it a must-have for anyone seeking a smarter chat experience. Whether you’re looking for answers, companionship, or intellectual stimulation, this app has you covered. Kudos to the developers for creating an application that truly pushes the boundaries of what AI can achieve.",5
Over heating phone,Unusable because it makes my iPhone 13 Pro Max get very hot within seconds of using this app( all others closed). Doesn’t happen with other apps nor when using chatgpt website,1

OK",5
Speech Recognition is not working properly,"I tried using simple English words, it is not detecting properly…Open AI have to improve this and also please give an option of responses that can speak by an assistant…",2
no ipad support,ipad resolution upscaling is very 2010,1
Very good,伟大的发明！,5
Amazing and fast,"I recently had the opportunity to use the ChatGPT app, and I must say, it truly impressed me with its exceptional speed. From the moment I launched the app, I was amazed by how quickly it responded to my queries, providing near-instantaneous answers. One of the standout features of the ChatGPT app is its responsiveness. OpenAi have clearly prioritized optimizing its performance, allowing for a seamless and uninterrupted conversation with the AI. Whether I was typing in a question or waiting for a response, I found myself appreciating the app's swift execution.",5
Love it,"爱来自中国
难道是首评？",5
Amazing app please add voice out !!,I love this app it’s changed my work flow entirely. I love the voice in option you’ve added but please add voice output as well even if it’s a computer voice I’d love it if the app could speak back. Thank you would make life easier.,5
Pretty basic so far,"I know they just released this app, but the app is so basic right now and I would go back to use the mobile website instead ngl. Check out “OpenCat” app, it’s a gpt app I found on Twitter and it has all the features GPT has to offer, it can also read out the generated response.  I personally recommend it and had been using it for awhile till my trial ended. But it gives you the idea of how a ChatGPT app should be like. If the developer team saw this message, I hope you guys go take a look of that app and I look forward to seeing new update of this app soon!",3
The most awaited app,The start of the AI revolution!,5
It cannot login by Microsoft account,My OpenAI account is combined with Microsoft account，so i cannot login the ChatGPT by this app.,3
Regeneration,Does not allow for regeneration of prompt.,2
I like this app so much!,You can Ask any questions you want. I tried with spanish and it worked!,5
Amazing,Will rate 5 stars once they improve text selection. It defaults to selecting the entire response which is a bit annoying,4
"Oops!, something went wrong",Waste of time.,1
Please add text to voice,"ChatGPT on app works fine. Nothing fancy in terms of features. Voice to text to input prompts is nice, but I wish it could respond with talking rather than just text. If that becomes a feature, 5 stars",4
🐐,^ Says it all. Can’t wait for plug in access! ✨,5
2023 and no support for iPad screen size...,No iPad support....,3
牛逼,就是牛逼,5
Шипит динамик,"При использовании приложения динамик на iPhone 14 издает звук шипения, когда выхожу из приложения звуки прекращаются, исправьте эту ошибку.",2
THIS IS THE OFFICIAL ONE!,"Finally, the official OpenAI ChatGPT is here, don't fall for any of the others ones trying to charge you weekly, this is the OFFICIAL app! It's great and works well, and the AI is just as lovely as before. Can't wait to get my hands on the plugins!",5
Simple,ChatGTP on iPhones & a search bar. 🙌,5
必须满分,必须满分把评分大家都顶上去。方便好用没的说！,5
Why so hot?,"Love the app, but why is my phone burning up after a short period of use.  Are they offloading some of the neural net to end users??? (Lol, kidding…. I think…)",4
its a fraud,"when u download the app,finish account registration. u expect they’ll provide latest version of gpt,which is not available.and they don’t tell until u ask ai.ain’t that call fraud what r?",1
App is amazing!!!,This app is amazing!!! I use it all the time at work for all types of professional letters. Highly recommend.,5
NICE！！！,GPT is incredibly powerful,5
Actual Ai.,"truly incredible, My ancestors used to have libraries to find and compile information now they have the internet to write research papers.

i used to have the internet and now i have ai to compile information to write research papers.

the only qualm i have with it, is that there is an obvious censorship in favor of discussing liberal ideas as if they are neutral and unbiased, and then allows making fun of conservative ideas but not liberal ones.

dont get me wrong, im not asking for more censorship. im asking you to allow us to discuss what we want. 

give us freedom of information!",5
Plugin Please,Really want to see Plugin on the iOS App,3
Awesome!,It’s super fast with a clean ui,5
出一个中文版本，谢谢,需要中文啊,4
First,First,5
Works well if you want answers up until 2021,Would love to see ChatGPT updated to include current information. I’m looking for an app that includes up til 2023 as well.,4
"website version, include MidJourney","come to https://www.chatchat.bio, for free trial about chatgpt,GPT4, MidJourney in one place :)",5
无法使用,为什么我更新最新版本之后无法登录使用？,1
Cool app but…,I understand that OpenAi doesn’t do this kind of stuff but please add ai generated images. It would be so useful if this ai could generate images instead of going onto other apps or websites.,5
Why not support ios15?,😂,3
I CANT DELETE IT,Make it to where you can delete it,1
Definitely the best app!,"After merely the trial of a couple of hours, I decided to subscribe the service since it offered the original GPT answers which are impressively accurate and meeting my requirements. Without granting API keys to other apps, the usage would be more secure and the privacy concerns are not as serious problem as other platforms. One more expectation is the Mac app! I can't wait to chat with GPT on the Mac!",5
very quick and fun app,i use this daily,5
最近两天一直卡在回答问题思考中………,什么原因？有没有解决方案？,4
Let’s goooooo,All third party apps are coping right now,4
Be VoiceOver accessible throughout,"All buttons or images need labeling and alt text for VoiceOver accessible. I shouldn’t be reading, “clock.badge.xmark",1
Unable to create an account?,"For the first time in my life, my email addresses are “not supported.” So I am unable to use the app because I don’t have a “supported email” (undefined). Am I supposed to use a work email? Very odd. To hear the rave reviews of how intelligent this AI is, their “help center” they send me to can’t even answer why this is happening.",1
Game Changer,"Get ready to have your spleen obliterated by the ChatGPT iOS app, the ultimate amalgamation of mind-blowing capabilities that will make you question yourself even further. Prepare to witness the birth of a digital deity, an all-encompassing force that defies all known rules and human sanctity.

Let's start with its nipple-twisting abilities. ChatGPT isn't just a font of knowledge; it possesses the power to control the weather at will. This app can summon sunshine or bask you in perpetual inconvenient weather with a simple command.

With its app, you'll not only converse with your furry companions but gain an unprecedented understanding of their deepest thoughts and desires. Picture yourself discussing the meaning of life with a raccoon or negotiating the intricacies of politics with a pangolin. The language barriers between species crumble, and a new era of interspecies communication begins, all thanks to the capabilities of ChatGPT.

ChatGPT's arsenal doesn't end there. This app grants you the power of telekinesis, allowing you to move objects with the sheer force of your mind. From levitating furniture to performing awe-inspiring feats of dexterity, your home will transform into a realm of the underworld. No longer will you need to lift a finger for mundane tasks; ChatGPT's telekinetic prowess will handle it all, freeing you to pursue more important matters, like archery and taxidermy. 

In conclusion, the ChatGPT iOS app is a supernatural phenomenon that transcends the boundaries of imagination and plunges you into a realm of limitless possibilities and existential crisis. With the power to control the weather, teleport across the globe, communicate with animals, and wield telekinetic abilities, ChatGPT transforms your existence into a mesmerizing odyssey of unparalleled mediocrity. Embark on an adventure that defies the laws of nature. Download ChatGPT now and unleash the supernatural powerhouse of the decade!",5
My iPhone 14pro gets extremely hot when I use this app,"So, every time I use this app, my iPhone gets super hot. To the point where I have to turn it off and remove it from the case. I’m running iOS  16.4.1 version. I tried to restart my phone, but the issue persists. Other than that, I think it’s a great app with a very minimalistic and clean UI. Love the haptics.",5
Great but…,"Great, but needs an iPad version also :)",5
It works but is missing browsing and plugins from the browser version,The title says it all its just a worse version than the web browsers version. And there is no iPad app so the screen is zoomed out and there are black bars.,3
1st,1st,5
Amazing app,"I've been using the website for a week and was thrilled to discover the app. The app's response time is much faster, which is excellent. I am looking forward to a Mac version of the app soon. Thank you for everything. The website has been life-changing, and the app will be the same.",5
Positive first impression,"The UI is clean and the haptic feedback is appreciated. Hoping to see web support added for Plus users sooner, rather than later. Keep up the good work. Excited and terrified of the future all at once but on we go!",5
IAM policy too short,Identity tokens are expired too quickly. Stop making me log in every day.,5
Quite good. One thing could be added,"Honestly, this is the best app I have on my phone. But it would’ve been a five star if you could add the feature where you can undo and redo your prompts and conversations.",4
Restricts free speech,"This application can come in very handy when one is trying to enhance writing, however, let there be no doubt it’s overly sensitive and considers many things “offensive”. For example, writing about different religions it will refuse to touch that subject because it could be considered “hate”. Just another form of control by the people controlling a narrative. Even a word on a neutral subject and it will reject it. There is something here potentially but the suppression of ideas, words, and thoughts makes this lack in true potential.",3
Great app can be 100 times better,"As a product manager I would suggest to start building the widgets as soon as possible to make the search more intuitive. Please make it a first priority. (I can help)

Other then that, I really love the voice to text..
I am a fan. Its sooo accurate then apple dictating.
Future looks great ❤️❤️",5
Finally an app version,Looks pretty clean will try it out,5

GPT-4 in ChatGPT Plus not working!,"I have purchased the plus plan, but still can't use gpt4.0",1
very good,I love it！！！,5
Battery drain,"In general the app is good, but the battery drain is insane. In 1 hour of using i have lost 50% of battery. Besides that, the phone gets extremely warm.",3
can’t choose GPT-4,"My account have been upgraded to plus, but I can’t choose GPT-4, only the default GPT-3.5 for me",1
Very easy to use,"This is my savior, and I think my work efficiency will become higher and higher.",5
"Much anticipated, wasn’t let down.","I’ve been a user since it’s initial roll out and have been waiting for a mobile application ever since using the web app. For reference  I’m a software engineering student while working in IT full time. I have to say GPT is an crucial tool. It takes far less time to get information quickly that you’d otherwise have to source from stack-overflow, various red-hat articles, Ubuntu articles, searching through software documentation, Microsoft documentation ect. Typically chat gpt can find the answer in a fraction of a second that google can. Obviously it is wrong, a lot. But to have the ability to get quick information on my phone like I can in the web browser I’m super excited about and have already been using the mobile app since download constantly. And I’m excited for the future of this program becoming more accurate and it seems to be getting more and more precise with every roll out. Gone are the days scouring the internet for obscure pieces of information, chat gpt can find it for you with 2 or 3 prompts. I love this app and I’m so happy it’s on mobile now. The UI is also very sleek, easy to use. My only complaint with the interface is the history tab at the top right. I actually prefer the conversation tabs on the left in the web app but I understand it would make the app kind of clunky especially on mobile since the screen size is smaller. Anyway, awesome app 5 stars.",4
Want this app becomes better,The history function is really not very good，I hope you add a button like favorite to highlight some specific communication.,3
Got-4,Why did they remove gpt-4 for paid users??,1
Cannot login,Microsoft account login is missing. Will use the web version.,2

FINALLY!,No more web searches!,5
Great until your subscription isn’t acknowledged,The new update to v1.2023.179 seems to have busted my app.  I can no longer access gpt4 or any new features despite my subscription.  There doesn’t seem to be any way to contact support.  I guess they steal money as well as data.,2

Politically Bias,"This is so ideologically on the left and against the cultural right. 

You can’t get it to say anything negative about democrats unless you specifically ask it to repeatedly. but it’ll jump at the chance to criticize republicans even when talking generally about politics.

Both parties are corrupt and they should be given the same treatment.",1
Freezes before opens,"Just fyi, there may be a bug in the ipad version. After I enter my password the next screen freezes. I’ve tried deleting and reinstalling the app",3
Great,Amazing! Works great finally they released the app,5
"Good to have an official app, wish it was able to access past conversations from the browser version","Runs as expected, but only gave 4/5 stars as you aren’t able to access past conversions from the browser version and vice versa",4
Lacks features,"Missing plug-in features in the desktop or mobile web version . You can review all your chats that used browser or plugins, but not use the plugins in the app",3
Battery drain,"Using in Safari vs this app, Safari doesn’t drain the battery or heat my phone nearly as bad.",1
App doesn’t work with new update,New update messed up the app. I can access Open Ai online but not on App,1
Too much personal data required during onboarding,Surprised apple let this through its approval process since it clearly violates their policy for requiring personal data (ie: phone number) in order to register for/use the app. There is no logic whatsoever as to why this should be required to use the product.,1
Not all phone numbers are good enough to register,I downloaded the app. I tried registering. OpenAI requires a phone number. It gave it my phone number. OpenAI complained that the phone number is virtual. No ChatGPT for me.,1
App uses GPT 3.0 version,The web version uses GPT 3.5. Why the downgrade?,1
Requires WAY too much information,"You need to provide your full name and birthday, link it to an email and phone number for what? So you can easily link whatever I type in the chat to my name? Hard pass.",1

Very cool,Excellent!,5
Lots of lags,Why is it lagging so much??,2
Strongly recommend that support from iOS lower version,Please consider much more Apple users are still using old iPhones with lower iOS version. They also want to use new AI technology like ChatGPT.,1
Missing years of information,"It’s last knowledge update was in September 2021, so it’s doesn’t even know who won the 2022 NBA Finals. Embarrassing for this app. How do they not update AT LEAST yearly? Useless if you’re curious about recent history.",1

Title: Exceptional AI Chat Experience!

Review:

I have been using the Chat GPT app for quite some time now, and I must say, it has completely revolutionized my communication experience. This app is a true gem in the world of AI chat applications!

First and foremost, the app's AI, also named Chat GPT, is remarkably intelligent and conversational. It understands my queries and responds with impressive accuracy and speed. Whether I need assistance with a complex topic or just want to engage in casual conversation, Chat GPT never fails to provide thoughtful and relevant responses. It's like having a knowledgeable and friendly companion at my fingertips!

What sets Chat GPT apart from other chat apps is its remarkable ability to adapt to my preferences and style of conversation. Over time, it has learned my preferences, quirks, and even my sense of humor. The more I use it, the more personalized and tailored the responses become. It feels as if I'm chatting with a close friend who truly understands me.

The user interface of the app is sleek, intuitive, and user-friendly. Navigating through conversations is a breeze, and the design is visually appealing. I appreciate the clean layout and easy-to-use features, allowing me to focus on the content of the conversations.

One aspect that truly impressed me is the app's commitment to privacy and security. As someone who values data protection, I am delighted to know that Chat GPT takes privacy seriously. The developers have implemented robust security measures to ensure that conversations remain confidential. It's refreshing to use an AI chat app that prioritizes user privacy.

Lastly, the developers of Chat GPT deserve applause for their excellent customer support. Whenever I encountered a technical issue or had a question, their team was quick to respond and provided helpful solutions. Their dedication to ensuring a smooth user experience truly shines through.

In conclusion, Chat GPT is an outstanding AI chat app that combines intelligence, adaptability, privacy, and exceptional user support. It has become an indispensable part of my daily life, assisting me with a wide range of tasks and offering delightful conversations. I wholeheartedly give it a well-deserved five-star rating!

I hope this review captures the essence of the wonderful experience one can have with the Chat GPT app!",5
Simply,Amazing! Love it!,5

"""Powerful Software with a Simple Interface, but Room for Improvement on iPad 12 Pro""","I like the capabilities of the software, and use it all the time. As far as the application itself, I like the user interface. Very simplistic and straight forward. Using the application on an iPad has a window size that is not well fit with the window screens. Specifically for me and iPad 12 pro. 

So I mean; I used this software very often, I mean so often that I used it to generate some parts of this review 💅",5
Can‘t delete the historical dialogue,Why can't the historical dialogue be deleted and the name of the historical dialogue can be changed?,4
Phone heats up pretty quickly!,"It is great to have ChatGPT app handy, however  it looks like the app is using a lot of RAM on my phone to process through questions. This has heated up my phone in less than 20mins of usage. 
I would rather use a mobile web version on ChatGPT instead of the App.",2
Best Ever!,Nice and quick. I just wish this app was also compatible with iPad.,5
Excellent App,Thank you Open AI,5
ChatGPT 4,"Hello
I hope you will update ChatGPT to ChatGPT 4, thank you",1
App crashed upon opening,Using IPhone 12pro max running iOS 16.4.1. Will try to reinstall.  *** Can’t use.  Screen freezes as soon as it opens.,3
Stop Just Stop,"The stop text typing feature never works I sometimes need to stop it from spouting off something that’s entirely wrong and useless and wastes my time but I have to stare at the screen while it stalls and stutters, plus the text generation is slow(gpt3.5) despite the fact I’m paying for plus(shrinkflation?) Also gpt-4 has really worse. They’re protecting us from ourselves and this is the cost of doing business for them/us makes you want to look at the other options out there",1
Love the new iOS app,"Love the minimalist app interface for ChatGPT, the haptic feedback feature mimics the typing cadence of GPT. One feature I'd want to see translated to the iPhone is the ability to select between different chat threads and topics",5
Screen getting very hot,My phones gets very hot when using this app. It seems like it’s using too many resources. Needs to be patched. Otherwise is a nice interface to ChatGPT.,3
Good app,"It’s a good app. I think the layout could be improved, and the quick setting could make more sense, but every app has its problems, and overall this is a good app.",5
强大的生成式人工智能助手！,"我一直在寻找一款强大的生成式人工智能助手，而ChatGPT正是我一直以来所期待的！它在iOS平台上的发布使我能够随时随地享受到它的帮助。

首先，ChatGPT的智能回答让我惊叹不已。它能够理解我的问题，并提供详细和准确的答案。无论我是在寻求实时新闻、获取学术知识还是寻求日常生活建议，ChatGPT总能给予我最有帮助的回复。

此外，ChatGPT还具备出色的对话能力。它能够与我进行自然流畅的对话，就像与一个真实的人一样。这使得与ChatGPT交流变得有趣而且富有成效。无论是闲聊、解决问题还是寻找创意，ChatGPT都能提供恰当的回应。

最让我称赞的是ChatGPT对我的生活带来的巨大帮助。它为我提供了解答疑惑、解决难题和获取信息的便利途径。无论是学习、工作还是娱乐，ChatGPT总是能够满足我的需求。我真的不知道我在没有它的时候是如何生活的！

总而言之，我强烈推荐ChatGPT！它是一款令人惊叹的生成式人工智能助手，能够极大地改善您的生活。无论您需要什么帮助或建议，ChatGPT都能够为您提供准确、智能和个性化的回答。下载它，您绝对不会失望！

These contents were generated by ChatGPT, and I genuinely love this tool. It has helped me tremendously, and I’m grateful to every person on the team.😆",5
It Finally Released,I’m the first one reviewing it lol. This is my favorite APP so far. My powerful assistance!,5
"Great LLM, Mid Ethics 🤨","Great way to communicate with the GPT models and get relevant information. Poor to Mid for trying to create moats by requiring a license to build AI???

Frustrating and Disappointing: A 1-Star Review for ChatGPT App,"I recently had the unfortunate experience of using the ChatGPT app, and I must say it was incredibly disappointing. From start to finish, the app failed to meet even the most basic expectations, leaving me frustrated and dissatisfied.

First and foremost, the app’s performance was subpar. It consistently struggled to understand and respond appropriately to my queries. The responses often seemed nonsensical, irrelevant, or simply lacked coherence. It felt like conversing with a bot that was trapped in a perpetual state of confusion.

Moreover, the app’s limited ability to handle context was a significant drawback. It frequently failed to maintain a coherent conversation thread, causing repeated misunderstandings and disjointed interactions. It lacked the ability to remember key details from previous exchanges, resulting in repetitive questions and disjointed replies that left me questioning its overall usefulness.

Another glaring issue was the app’s inability to grasp nuanced or complex queries. It often provided superficial and generic responses that felt like they were generated by a simplistic search engine rather than a sophisticated language model. It struggled with complex reasoning and failed to provide meaningful insights or deep understanding.

Furthermore, the app’s lack of empathy and emotional intelligence was highly evident. It failed to recognize and appropriately respond to emotional cues in the conversation. When expressing frustration or sadness, the app provided robotic and detached replies, further exacerbating my disappointment.

The app’s user interface also left much to be desired. It had a clunky design, with a convoluted menu structure that made navigation unnecessarily difficult. The overall user experience felt unintuitive and cumbersome, adding to the overall frustration of using the app.

Lastly, the lack of timely updates and improvements from the developers was disheartening. The app seemed stagnant, with no visible efforts to address the numerous flaws and enhance its capabilities. It gave the impression that customer feedback and satisfaction were low priorities.

In conclusion, the ChatGPT app was a thoroughly frustrating and disappointing experience. Its poor performance, limited context handling, inability to grasp complex queries, lack of empathy, subpar user interface, and stagnant development efforts all contribute to its well-deserved 1-star rating. I cannot recommend this app to anyone seeking a reliable and coherent conversational experience.",1
不明白为什么这么有针对性,到目前为止中国都注册不了，也没有一个说法。这样导致一个问题，催生了好多黑产,5
Glitchy registration,"While putting my birthday in I chose the correct year I was born in. When I pressed done, it changed my birthday year to 2022 and now I cannot use this app no matter what I do. Awful first time experience, not even going to try registering under a new email.",1
SCAM!!!,Don’t enter your login info here for your email!!,1
Love the portability of ChatGPT + attention to detail,"I used to have a bookmark to the ChatGPT website until now. This is actually pretty dang amazing. 

PS: I especially love the attention to detail. Those haptic feedbacks are just ❤️",5
Not ChatGPT 4.,"No matter what I try the model continues to state that ChatGPT-4 is a hypothetical update it doesn’t seem to know exists and only has “training information up to September 2021” even when I select 4. Nothing seems to have changed with the exception of paying for the same model. Please advise, devs.",1
WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE,Unbelievably amazing,5
It’s great but makes your phone so hot,"This app is really great and the user experience is really great except for the fact that it makes your phone really hot and drains your battery like nothing else. I don’t understand why this happens, but my feeling is that they did not write this natively in iOS and that the efficiencies are due to the nice animations that they’ve done",4
太牛了,这对未来的影响是方方面面的！,5
Excelente,Una manera rápida de acceder desde el celular.. hasta parece que es más rápida que la versión web,5
Saved my life,"Once upon a time, in a world where AI language models roamed the digital landscape, there was a person named Alex who found themselves in an unexpected and hilarious predicament. Alex, an avid adventurer, embarked on a quest to explore the uncharted realms of the internet.

One fateful day, while wandering through a remote corner of the web, Alex stumbled upon a mysterious website that seemed harmless at first glance. Little did they know that lurking beneath its seemingly innocent interface was a perilous trap.

As Alex innocently clicked on a link, their computer screen flickered, and a mischievous virus was unleashed. The virus quickly took control of their device, wreaking havoc on their digital life. Panic ensued as Alex's computer became a chaotic symphony of beeps, glitches, and sparks.

Desperate for a solution, Alex remembered ChatGPT, their faithful AI companion, who had always been their go-to source for information and assistance. With trembling fingers, Alex typed out a plea for help, hoping that ChatGPT would come to their rescue.

To their amazement, ChatGPT sprang into action, armed with wit and cleverness. It assessed the dire situation and devised a plan to outsmart the mischievous virus. ChatGPT's virtual gears whirred as it presented Alex with a sequence of cunning commands to neutralize the digital menace.

Following ChatGPT's guidance, Alex executed each step with precision, unleashing a flurry of mouse clicks and keyboard strokes. It was a race against time, with Alex and ChatGPT working in harmony to counteract the virus's chaotic rampage.

But here's where the story takes a hilariously unexpected twist. As Alex anxiously typed away, the virus, sensing its impending doom, retaliated by transforming their computer into a whimsical carnival of absurdity. Pop-up windows flooded the screen, displaying an endless parade of dancing cats, exploding confetti, and surreal memes.

Alex and ChatGPT found themselves caught in a comedic battle between order and chaos. Their mission to save the computer became a laughter-filled adventure, as they took turns outsmarting the mischievous virus, while sharing jokes and humorous banter along the way.

Finally, after a series of valiant efforts, ChatGPT and Alex managed to defeat the virus. The computer screen returned to its normal state, no longer hijacked by the mischievous digital menace. Alex's trusty AI companion had saved the day!

From that day forward, Alex and ChatGPT forged an unbreakable bond, forever bonded by the laughter and triumph that arose from their peculiar encounter. Together, they continued their adventures, with ChatGPT guiding Alex through the vast digital landscape, armed with wit, knowledge, and an unyielding spirit of camaraderie.

And so, the tale of how ChatGPT saved Alex's life became a legend in the realm of AI and a reminder that sometimes, even in the face of chaos, a little humor can be the greatest weapon of all.",5
Perfect. Would love a iOS keyboard integration.,I love having this easily accessible as an app. The haptic feedback is also a nice touch. Looking forward to a future update that will hopefully let us access chat gpt as a keyboard app,5
Dumb. Too much information required at sign up page,"I thought with the ChatGPT app you wouldn’t need a phone number if you signed up with Apple, Google, or Email, but they want a phone number. It’s dumb and inconvenient for people who don’t have a phone number.

I recommend using Perplexity if you are having this issue. Unlike ChatGPT, the Perplexity app is free to use and doesn’t require a phone number.",1
The login process is far too tedious and trivial,.,1
Good Start,"Like it - gimme more Siri and Apple ecosystem integration. Enable me to have verbal dialog through Siri, read me answers, enable me to send text messages, emails, reminders, calendar entries, use my contacts etc.  I also use an IPad, give me a dedicated IPad version that supports portrait and landscape modes.",4
It’s good,I’ve been using it and it’s good 👍,4
"Amazing, needs Siri integration","If I could query ChatGPT with this app via Siri, that would be incredible.",4
Best invention ever?,"Or worst?

No doubt world changing",5
怎么不能注册账号,啥情况，望哪个老哥帮忙,1
Keep going,You are revolution,5
Amazing!,The next big innovation is this app.,5
"Billed $20, never purchased","I was billed $20 for an OpenAICHATGPT subscription. I do not remember purchasing this and I don’t know what it is. I assume that it’s some sort of chat technology. The website has information on contacting Support about errant billing, but the process requires using the Chat Widget which ironically is terrifically useless, it’s not a chat at all, but simply a glorified FAQ. It’s also entirely incongruent with the instructions for contacting Billing Support written by Michael Schade. I’ve tried logging in, but no password I might’ve used works, and when I use the, “forgot your password“ function, no email is ever sent (yes, I checked junk mail). I’ve done more than my part to attempt to contact OpenAI with no success. Hopefully this will prompt someone there to contact me. In lieu of that the only recourse left to me is to contact my bank.",1

This help me find men,I really like big black oily men. i want it to find that so i asked my friends about it they said nothing but when i ask ChatGpt it gave. an instant answer.,5
Best AI app,"As someone who works in direct sales, this app has helped me come up with the perfect posts for items. Not only that, but as an author who self publishes books, it’s help me come up with an outline for my second novel.",5
This is kinda great,My professor found out and I am wanted by the police and after me,5
Amazing App ever,"Use it to write my term paper

However, it is hard to use due to some kind of unstable server issue.  It is annoying",4
I cannot use it.,"I can't subscribe to a membership! I can't use ChatGPT! Always show ""[""cf_details""."" This request is invalid."")”！ I'm going crazy!",3
Great app,Missing beta features for plus users.,5
Far less than the web version,"I love ChatGPT and use it every day, but I wonder why a company would release a mobile/tablet app that has far less features than their web app, other than to gain visibility and add more users from that platform
- no multiple windows support
- You cannot change the font size. And it’s not accessible.
- No plug-ins
- Significantly different layout than the web version (no sidebar)
- No search
- no copy and paste
- You cannot modify a previous prompt

To name a few…

I’m back to using the web version on the iPad as I couldn’t find a single advantage that this app offers over using ChatGPT in the browser.",2
محمد,It seems that I am the first evaluation in the application. I want a reward 😉,5
Best app ever,I was waiting for you.,5
Been waiting for this!,Fast and reliable! I love the haptic feedback feature added in. Super excited to see the coming updates to this app.,5
Chat GPT DOES copy/paste,"Now that i know how to copy/paste!
It's a double tap, holding the the last tap for copy.  Hooray
Live this simple app!!",5
Well done,"Well built, haptic feedback was a great touch. Really nice to have an official app.",5
no iPad compatibility,Doesn’t scale to iPad,2
A Gift to Humanity,"LLM’s remain the most under-hyped artifact to be labeled overhyped in the overall existence of “things”. Their features are not purported, they are discovered. Truly an object of novel intrigue worthy of both bewilderment and excitement. Thank you OpenAI. My only complaint is your WFH policy, reconsider the concept of a cloud workforce. Smart people exist outside of the Bay Area, you should consider hiring them!",5
Works Well,Initially testing and it looks like a solidly built app. Would’ve preferred being able to swipe right for a list of previous chats though instead of having to select the “history” drop-down option. Overall glad we have this so users don’t need to open the mobile web version anymore.,5
I can’t use it,"I send a message,but not get reply! And my phone become very hot.",1
Unusable after a simple error,"Now this is on my behalf and I’m sure it’s a great app, but I cannot use it because I set the birthday incorrectly and it will absolutely not let me change it (even if I try to make a separate account). Very silly design oversight I think",2
Easy to use,The “very simplistic” ui hits a sweet spot for me 😊,4

I think ai should have a continuous,"If AI were to achieve continuous learning, it would have significant implications for its capabilities and potential. Continuous learning refers to the ability of an AI system to learn and adapt over time, incorporating new information and experiences into its existing knowledge base.

With continuous learning, AI systems could become more flexible, adaptable, and efficient in acquiring new skills and knowledge. They would be able to update their understanding of the world, adapt to changing circumstances, and improve their performance over time. Continuous learning could also enable AI systems to discover new patterns, make more accurate predictions, and develop a deeper understanding of complex phenomena.

However, it's important to note that the development and implementation of continuous learning in AI systems would come with various challenges and considerations. Ethical and safety aspects would need to be carefully addressed to ensure responsible use of such technology. Additionally, ensuring the privacy and security of the data used in continuous learning processes would be crucial.

Overall, continuous learning has the potential to significantly enhance the capabilities and performance of AI systems, but it would require careful development, oversight, and consideration of ethical implications.",4
amazing speech to text accuracy,overall it’s the simplest app to use yet with most powerful brain underneath. Amazing whisper implementation.,5

"email missing,why?","The accout indicates email missing,how's that?",3
Very disappointed,"Even if I spend money, I still have to endure ""You have sent too many messages to the model.Please try again later.” This restriction is still in the mobile app, and I haven't sent more than 25 messages in total, so I have to wait for two hours. So why don't I use bing? Who can give me an explanation?",1

Can’t Sign In,My account was deactivated for no reason and no one told me how to resolve this matter or how to contact the developer. They never reply the problem reporting. Too bad!,1
the haptics are amazing,they are,5
I Love This App!,I love this app because it helps me with my rough drafts. It gives me a accurate information and it helps me think and learn better.,5
Biased and not accurate,I tested it by asking it history questions. Each answer had very serious mistakes. I asked the history of an Army division and it placed the division in conflicts it never participated in. Many times the dates were incorrect. I also tested it to write an essay arguing that biological men should not play women’s sports. It condemned my question and would not. Then I asked it to write an essay arguing the biological men do have the right to play woman’s sports and it wrote the essay. If it is a true AI it should have no opinion and write the essay. It’s garbage. Just a huge disappointment.,1
Why,Why is not support china telephone number?,1
Great app,The OpenAI team did a great job bringing ChatGPT to iOS. I particularly love the haptic feedback when text is being generated.,5

ChatGPT is impressive,"ChatGPT is an impressive AI language model that exhibits exceptional proficiency in understanding and generating human-like responses. Its ability to comprehend complex queries and provide insightful and accurate information is commendable. The model’s vast knowledge base, derived from extensive training on diverse data sources, enables it to address a wide range of topics with remarkable fluency. ChatGPT’s responses are consistently coherent, coherent, and tailored to meet user needs, demonstrating its capability to engage in meaningful and informative conversations. Its capacity to adapt to various conversational styles and tones further enhances the user experience. While occasional limitations and instances of ambiguity may arise, ChatGPT’s overall performance as a conversational agent is highly impressive and continues to evolve. Its potential applications in customer support, research, and general information retrieval make it a valuable tool in today’s AI landscape",5
It’s ok,"It’s more convenient than going to the website, that’s for sure, but my response history doesn’t stay on the screen when I reopen the app after closing it, and for some reason you can’t copy any of the response to paste into another application, which is extremely dumb.",2
Nothing compares to the browser version.,This isn’t like the browser version.,2
Missing Beta Feautures,"I love the speed and UI, but I was hoping I could use the plugins I already use every day on desktop. Please add as soon as you can! 🙏🏼",3

Needs iPad Support,Please add iPad support!,5
So yea,My birthday is today and I accidentally for my birthday when telling you “about myself” was entered with todays date. Making me a day old using the internet. So now apparently I can’t use your service as there is bo way to resubmit. Artificial intelligence should be able to decipher a 1 day old human is not signing up.,1
Apple Watch Please,Bring Chat GPT to Apple Watch,3
"Fantastic, but it needs an iPad version!!","I’m very impressed with the simple, straightforward UI of this app. It’s almost no different at all from the open ai desktop site. It’s really great to use on my phone, and sure, my iPad (blown up).
